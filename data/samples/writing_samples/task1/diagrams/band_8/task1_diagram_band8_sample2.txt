[QUESTION]
The diagram illustrates the life cycle of a butterfly.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram describes the four-stage life cycle of a butterfly, beginning with eggs laid on leaves and ending with mature adults capable of reproduction.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The diagram describes the four-stage life cycle of a butterfly, beginning with eggs laid on leaves and ending with mature adults capable of reproduction. Overall, it is a cyclic biological process involving transformation at each stage.
Initially, eggs are deposited on plant leaves. These hatch into larvae, commonly known as caterpillars, which feed continuously and grow in size. They then form a chrysalis, within which metamorphosis occurs. After this transformation, adult butterflies emerge and begin the cycle again by laying eggs.

[OVERVIEW]
A four-stage cycle from egg to adult.

[RATIONALE]
• Accurate biological detail
• Very clear progression
• Good vocabulary (metamorphosis, emerge)
• Slightly concise but still strong
