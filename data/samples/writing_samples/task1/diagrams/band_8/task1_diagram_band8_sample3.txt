[QUESTION]
The diagram shows how electricity is generated in a hydroelectric power station.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram demonstrates the operation of a hydroelectric station, which converts stored water into electricity. Overall, it illustrates a cyclical process where water flows from a reservoir through turbines and returns downstream.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The diagram demonstrates the operation of a hydroelectric station, which converts stored water into electricity. Overall, it illustrates a cyclical process where water flows from a reservoir through turbines and returns downstream.
During the day, water held in a high-level reservoir is released through a narrow channel, turning turbines connected to a generator. This produces electricity that is transmitted to the national grid. At night, when demand is lower, water is pumped back into the upper reservoir using reversible turbines, preparing the system for the next cycle.

[OVERVIEW]
A day–night cycle involving flow, generation, and pumping.

[RATIONALE]
• Strong coherence
• Accurate technical explanation
• Effective structure
• Could include more numerical detail
