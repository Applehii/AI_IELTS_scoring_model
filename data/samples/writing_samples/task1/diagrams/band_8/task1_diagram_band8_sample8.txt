Band 8
The diagram depicts a rainwater treatment system used in residential areas. Overall, the system captures rainwater, filters it, treats it chemically, and supplies drinking water.
Rainwater is collected from roofs and directed into a storage tank. A pump transfers it through a filtration unit, removing sediment. The water then enters a chemical treatment tank where disinfectants eliminate bacteria. After treatment, the water flows into homes.

[OVERVIEW]
A simple purification system involving storage, filtration, and chemical treatment.
