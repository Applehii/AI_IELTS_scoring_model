[QUESTION]
The diagram shows how coffee beans are processed and prepared for sale.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram illustrates the stages involved in producing commercial coffee from freshly harvested beans. Overall, it follows a linear process beginning with drying and ending with packaging for export.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The diagram illustrates the stages involved in producing commercial coffee from freshly harvested beans. Overall, it follows a linear process beginning with drying and ending with packaging for export.
First, ripe coffee cherries are collected and dried under the sun until their moisture content is reduced. They are then roasted at high temperatures before undergoing rapid cooling. The roasted beans are ground into fine powder, which is subsequently mixed with hot water to create a concentrated liquid. This mixture is frozen, crushed, and dried again to remove remaining moisture. Finally, the processed coffee is packed into jars and sealed for distribution.

[OVERVIEW]
A multi-stage industrial process from drying to packaging.

[RATIONALE]
• Detailed, precise steps
• Excellent cohesion (subsequently, finally)
• Strong lexical resource
• Minor missing data on machinery
