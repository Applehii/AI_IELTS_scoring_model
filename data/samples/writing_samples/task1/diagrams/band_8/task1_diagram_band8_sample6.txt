[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The diagram presents the transformation of raw timber into finished paper. Overall, it consists of mechanical preparation, chemical processing, and sheet production.
Logs are first debarked and cut into wood chips. These are boiled with chemicals to form pulp. The pulp is washed, bleached, and refined before being fed into a roller system. Here, it is pressed and dried to form continuous sheets. The sheets are then cut, rolled, and packaged.

[OVERVIEW]
Process includes chipping, pulping, and rolling.
