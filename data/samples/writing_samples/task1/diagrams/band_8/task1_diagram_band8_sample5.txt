[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The diagram illustrates a household water purification system designed to convert contaminated water into drinking water. Overall, the system involves filtration, mineral balancing, and storage.
Water first enters a coarse filter, which removes large particles such as sand or debris. It then passes through an activated-carbon filter that eliminates odors and organic compounds. After that, the water moves into a mineral tank where essential minerals are added. Finally, the purified water flows into a storage tank for domestic use.

[OVERVIEW]
A four-stage filtration process with mineral enhancement.

[RATIONALE]
• Precise technical vocabulary
• Clear flow direction
• Strong cohesion
• Slightly short
