[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The diagram outlines the production of ceramic pots. Overall, it is a multi-stage process involving shaping, firing, decoration, and glazing.
Clay is molded into pot shapes and dried in a controlled environment. The dried pots are fired in a kiln at high temperatures. Once cooled, they are painted and fired again to set the colors. A glaze is applied, and the pots undergo a final firing before being ready for sale.

[OVERVIEW]
A manufacturing process with repeated firing stages.

[RATIONALE]
• Excellent sequencing
• Advanced vocabulary
• Strong cohesion
• Could specify temperatures
