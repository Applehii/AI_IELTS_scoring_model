[QUESTION]
The diagram shows how ethanol fuel is produced from corn.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram outlines the production of ethanol from corn through a series of mechanical and biological steps. Overall, the process involves milling, fermenting, and purifying before the final product is delivered.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The diagram outlines the production of ethanol from corn through a series of mechanical and biological steps. Overall, the process involves milling, fermenting, and purifying before the final product is delivered.
Corn is first stored before being milled into fine particles. Water is added, and the mixture is cooked for several hours. After cooling, enzymes are introduced to convert starch into sugar. The mixture undergoes a 48-hour fermentation process, producing ethanol and solid by-products. The ethanol is then separated and purified for five hours. Finally, it is stored and transported.

[OVERVIEW]
A linear process with milling, fermentation, and purification.

[RATIONALE]
• Accurate sequencing
• Strong academic tone
• Good use of time durations
• Could expand on equipment
