[QUESTION]
The diagram shows how wind is used to generate electricity.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram illustrates the operation of a wind-powered electricity system. Overall, wind energy is converted into electricity through mechanical rotation and electrical generation.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The diagram illustrates the operation of a wind-powered electricity system. Overall, wind energy is converted into electricity through mechanical rotation and electrical generation.
Wind turns the blades of a turbine, which rotates a shaft connected to a generator. This produces electricity that is sent to a transformer, where voltage is adjusted before entering the power grid.

[OVERVIEW]
A simple three-stage conversion process.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear, succinct, accurate
• Very coherent
• Good academic tone
• Could include grid flow detail
