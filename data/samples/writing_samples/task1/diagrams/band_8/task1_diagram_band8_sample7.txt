[QUESTION]
The diagram illustrates how bees produce honey.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram describes the honey-making process used by bees. Overall, it involves nectar collection, processing, and storage within the hive.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The diagram describes the honey-making process used by bees. Overall, it involves nectar collection, processing, and storage within the hive.
Worker bees extract nectar from flowers and store it in their stomachs, mixing it with enzymes. Back at the hive, the nectar is passed between bees to reduce its moisture. It is then deposited into wax cells. Bees fan the cells with their wings to dry the liquid further before sealing the honeycomb with wax.

[OVERVIEW]
Natural biological process with several transformation steps.

[RATIONALE]
• Strong vocabulary
• Very coherent stages
• Good biological accuracy
• Lacks quantity markers
