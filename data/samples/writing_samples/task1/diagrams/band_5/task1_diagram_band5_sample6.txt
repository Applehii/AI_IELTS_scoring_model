[QUESTION]
The diagram shows how electricity is generated from waves.

[SUMMARY]
Waves hit the machine and move a floating device. This movement goes to a generator that creates electricity.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
Waves hit the machine and move a floating device. This movement goes to a generator that creates electricity. After that, the electricity travels in cables to houses. The diagram shows renewable energy using wave power.

[OVERVIEW]
Wave movement changes into electricity.

[RATIONALE]
• Missing turbine mechanics  
• Vague explanation  
• Short, lacks complexity
