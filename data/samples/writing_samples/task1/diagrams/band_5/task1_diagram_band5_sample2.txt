[QUESTION]
The diagram illustrates the water cycle.

[SUMMARY]
The picture shows the water cycle, which has several stages. First, water from the sea is heated by the sun and becomes vapor.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
The picture shows the water cycle, which has several stages. First, water from the sea is heated by the sun and becomes vapor. Then it goes up and forms clouds. After that, rain falls down to the ground. Finally, the water flows back to the sea through rivers. This cycle keeps repeating.

[OVERVIEW]
The water changes form and returns to the sea again.

[RATIONALE]
• Process mostly correct but lacking detail  
• Simple linking words  
• No deeper explanation (evaporation, condensation missing)
