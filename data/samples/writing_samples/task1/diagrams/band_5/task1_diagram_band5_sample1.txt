[QUESTION]
The diagram shows how coffee is produced.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram explains the process of making coffee from beans. First, the beans are collected from the trees.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
The diagram explains the process of making coffee from beans. First, the beans are collected from the trees. Then they are dried under the sun for some time. After that, workers roast them and grind into powder. At the end, the coffee powder is packed and ready to sell. The stages happen in order until coffee is finished.

[OVERVIEW]
Coffee beans go through drying, roasting and grinding before packaging.

[RATIONALE]
• Steps mentioned but still too simple   
• Limited vocabulary  
• Grammar errors (grind into, ready to sell)  
• Overview still descriptive, not general
