[QUESTION]
The diagram illustrates milk production.

[SUMMARY]
Milk is made through several stages. Cows are milked by machines two times a day.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
Milk is made through several stages. Cows are milked by machines two times a day. Then the milk is stored in tanks to cool. After that, a truck transports the milk to a factory. There, it is cleaned and processed before being bottled. Finally, the bottles are sent to shops.

[OVERVIEW]
Milk goes from cows to factory and then to shops.

[RATIONALE]
• Mostly accurate steps  
• Lacks technical wording  
• Overview still too simple
