[QUESTION]
The diagram shows how bread is made.

[SUMMARY]

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
Bread production has a few steps. Flour, water and yeast are mixed together first. Then the dough is kneaded for a while. After resting, it is put into the oven to bake. When it is baked, the bread is cooled and packed for selling. The process is simple and goes step by step.

[OVERVIEW]
Bread is mixed, baked and then packed.

[RATIONALE]
• Correct order but too basic  
• Inconsistent grammar  
• Missing important details (proofing time, temperature)
