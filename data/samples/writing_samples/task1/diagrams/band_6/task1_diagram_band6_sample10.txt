[QUESTION]
The diagram explains the life cycle of a butterfly.

[SUMMARY]
A butterfly’s life cycle begins when eggs are laid on leaves. These eggs hatch into caterpillars, which eat leaves and grow.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
A butterfly’s life cycle begins when eggs are laid on leaves. These eggs hatch into caterpillars, which eat leaves and grow. After reaching a certain size, the caterpillar forms a chrysalis. Inside it, transformation occurs, and eventually an adult butterfly emerges, completing the cycle.

[OVERVIEW]
The butterfly goes through four main stages from egg to adult.

[RATIONALE]
• Generally accurate  
• Clear order  
• Still no scientific terms (metamorphosis)
