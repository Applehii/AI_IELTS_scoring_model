[QUESTION]
The diagram shows how electricity is generated using wave energy.

[SUMMARY]
As waves approach the machine, they push a floating device up and down. This movement powers a turbine connected to a generator.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
As waves approach the machine, they push a floating device up and down. This movement powers a turbine connected to a generator. The generator produces electricity, which is then transferred through cables to the electricity grid. This shows how wave motion is turned into energy.

[OVERVIEW]
Wave movement drives a turbine that generates electricity.

[RATIONALE]
• Sufficient detail  
• Still light on mechanics  
• Limited connectors
