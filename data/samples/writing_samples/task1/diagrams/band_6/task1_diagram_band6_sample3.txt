[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Bread is made through a series of steps. First, flour, yeast, salt, and water are mixed together. The mixture is kneaded to create dough. After resting for a few hours, the dough becomes larger and is shaped before being baked in an oven. Once baked, the bread is cooled and packed for distribution.

[OVERVIEW]
Bread production involves mixing, rising, baking and packaging.
