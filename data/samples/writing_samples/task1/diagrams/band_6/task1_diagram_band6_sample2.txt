[QUESTION]
The diagram shows the water cycle.

[SUMMARY]
The water cycle consists of several natural stages. Water from oceans is heated by the sun and evaporates, rising into the air.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
The water cycle consists of several natural stages. Water from oceans is heated by the sun and evaporates, rising into the air. This vapor cools and forms clouds through condensation. When clouds become heavy, rain falls on the land. The water then flows through rivers and eventually returns to the ocean, completing the cycle.

[OVERVIEW]
Water changes form and returns to the sea in a repeating cycle.

[RATIONALE]
• Describes processes correctly  
• Some academic vocabulary  
• Still lacks deeper explanation
