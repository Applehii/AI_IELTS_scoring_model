[QUESTION]
The diagram shows how drinking water is produced from seawater.

[SUMMARY]
The process starts with seawater being taken from the ocean and passed through a filter to remove sand and large particles.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
The process starts with seawater being taken from the ocean and passed through a filter to remove sand and large particles. After that, the water enters a desalination chamber where salt is separated from the liquid using heat and pressure. The clean water is then cooled and stored in a tank before being distributed to households through pipelines.

[OVERVIEW]
Seawater is filtered, desalinated and delivered as drinking water.

[RATIONALE]
• Correct sequence  
• Good clarity  
• Missing technical details (reverse osmosis, levels of pressure)
