[QUESTION]
The diagram illustrates the life cycle of a frog.

[SUMMARY]
The life cycle begins when eggs are laid in clusters on the surface of ponds. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, which have tails and breathe through gills.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
The life cycle begins when eggs are laid in clusters on the surface of ponds. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, which have tails and breathe through gills. As they grow, legs start to appear and their tails become shorter. Eventually, they develop into adult frogs and move onto land, completing the cycle.

[OVERVIEW]
The frog develops from egg to tadpole to adult.

[RATIONALE]
• Simple but correct  
• Limited scientific vocabulary  
• Could use more connectors
