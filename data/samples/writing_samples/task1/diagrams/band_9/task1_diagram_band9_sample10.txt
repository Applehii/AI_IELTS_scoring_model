[QUESTION]
The diagram shows the water cycle.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram illustrates the natural water cycle, a continuous system in which water circulates between the sea, the atmosphere, and the land.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The diagram illustrates the natural water cycle, a continuous system in which water circulates between the sea, the atmosphere, and the land. Overall, it involves evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and surface flow.

Warmth from the sun causes seawater to evaporate, forming water vapor that rises and cools. This vapor condenses into clouds, which eventually produce precipitation in the form of rain.

Some of this water infiltrates the ground as groundwater while the rest flows across the surface into rivers and streams, returning to the ocean and completing the cycle.

[OVERVIEW]
A continuous system driven by evaporation and precipitation.
