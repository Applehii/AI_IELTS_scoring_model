[QUESTION]
The diagram shows how bricks are produced for the construction industry.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram illustrates the brick-manufacturing process, which involves several mechanical, thermal, and quality-control stages. Overall, the system transforms raw clay into standardized building materials.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The diagram illustrates the brick-manufacturing process, which involves several mechanical, thermal, and quality-control stages. Overall, the system transforms raw clay into standardized building materials.

Clay is first excavated and passed through a metal grid to remove large particles before being mixed with sand and water. The resulting mixture is shaped either by a mould or a wire cutter to form uniform bricks. These wet bricks are then moved to a drying oven, where they remain for 24 to 48 hours.

Once dried, the bricks are fired in a kiln at gradually increasing temperatures ranging from moderate heat to over 1,000°C. They are then cooled in a separate chamber. Finally, the finished bricks are packaged and delivered.

[OVERVIEW]
A precise industrial process with drying, firing, and cooling stages.

[RATIONALE]
• Highly detailed and technical
• Excellent range: excavated, standardized, gradually increasing
• Clear multi-step logic
• Perfect grammar and cohesion
