[QUESTION]
The diagram shows the life cycle of a salmon.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram details the life cycle of a salmon, a species that undergoes several transformations from egg to mature adult.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The diagram details the life cycle of a salmon, a species that undergoes several transformations from egg to mature adult. Overall, it is a cyclical biological process involving migration between freshwater and the ocean.

The cycle begins when mature salmon lay their eggs among slow-moving river reeds. After hatching, the fry spend several months developing in these calm waters. As they grow into smolt, they migrate downstream toward the ocean.

In the oceanic stage, they live for several years, reaching full maturity. Adult salmon eventually return upstream to their original spawning grounds, completing the cycle and beginning it anew.

[OVERVIEW]
A migration-based cycle involving growth in rivers and maturity in the ocean.

[RATIONALE]
