[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The diagram explains the paper recycling process, which converts used paper into reusable material. Overall, it involves sorting, cleaning, pulping, and sheet formation.

Waste paper is first collected and sorted manually to separate recyclable material from contaminants. The selected paper is then shredded and washed to remove ink residues. After cleaning, the paper fibers are mixed with water and chemicals to form pulp.

The pulp undergoes refining and screening to ensure uniform texture before being sent to a roller system that presses and dries it into sheets. These sheets are cut, rolled, and packaged for commercial use.

[OVERVIEW]
A multi-stage process converting waste material into commercial paper.

[RATIONALE]
• Excellent technical precision
• Complex sentence structures
• Full cohesion with logical stages
• Wide academic vocabulary
