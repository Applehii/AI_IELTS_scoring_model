[QUESTION]
The diagram shows how electricity is produced using geothermal energy.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram demonstrates the operation of a geothermal power plant, which converts underground heat into usable electricity. Overall, the system relies on heated water, rising steam, and turbine-driven electricity generation.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The diagram demonstrates the operation of a geothermal power plant, which converts underground heat into usable electricity. Overall, the system relies on heated water, rising steam, and turbine-driven electricity generation.

Cold water is first pumped down through an injection well to permeable hot rocks located deep beneath the surface. As the water circulates, it absorbs geothermal heat and returns to the surface through a production well in the form of high-pressure steam.

This steam is then funneled into a turbine, causing it to spin at high speed. The turbine is connected to a generator, which converts mechanical rotation into electrical energy. Finally, the electricity is transmitted to the national grid for consumption.

[OVERVIEW]
A thermal–mechanical conversion cycle from hot rocks to grid-level electricity.
