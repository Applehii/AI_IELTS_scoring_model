[QUESTION]
The diagram illustrates how bees produce honey.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram describes the process by which honey is produced in a beehive. Overall, the natural cycle involves nectar collection, enzyme processing, evaporation, and storage.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The diagram describes the process by which honey is produced in a beehive. Overall, the natural cycle involves nectar collection, enzyme processing, evaporation, and storage.

Worker bees extract nectar from flowers and store it in their stomachs, where enzymes begin breaking down complex sugars. Upon returning to the hive, the bees regurgitate the nectar and pass it between one another to further reduce water content.

The partially processed nectar is then deposited into wax cells. Bees fan the liquid with their wings to accelerate evaporation. Once the honey reaches the correct viscosity, the cells are sealed with wax for long-term storage.

[OVERVIEW]
A biological process involving enzyme activity and evaporation.

[RATIONALE]
• Very strong scientific vocabulary
• Excellent flow and structure
• Detailed biological accuracy
• Elegant grammar and coherence
