[QUESTION]
The diagram illustrates how rainwater is collected and treated for domestic use.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram outlines a decentralized rainwater harvesting system designed to supply households with potable water. Overall, the system includes water collection, filtration, chemical treatment, and distribution.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The diagram outlines a decentralized rainwater harvesting system designed to supply households with potable water. Overall, the system includes water collection, filtration, chemical treatment, and distribution.

Rainwater is first captured from rooftops and directed into an underground storage tank via a system of gutters and pipes. A pump then transfers the collected water to a fine-filter unit, where physical impurities are removed. Following filtration, the water flows into a treatment chamber, where disinfectants are added to eliminate harmful microorganisms.

The treated water is subsequently transported through pipes to residential homes for drinking and household use.

[OVERVIEW]
A four-stage purification sequence from rooftop collection to household consumption.
