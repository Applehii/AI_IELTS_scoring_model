[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The diagram outlines the glass bottle recycling cycle, which transforms used containers into new products. Overall, the process consists of collection, sorting, melting, and remanufacturing.

First, used bottles are deposited into recycling bins and transported to a processing facility. They are sorted by color and cleaned to remove impurities. The cleaned glass is then crushed into cullet and melted in a furnace.

The molten glass is molded into new bottles, which are cooled, inspected for defects, and packaged for redistribution.

[OVERVIEW]
A full recycling cycle from disposal to remanufactured bottles.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear industrial accuracy
• Sophisticated vocabulary (cullet, molten, remanufactured)
• Perfect cohesion
• Advanced grammar patterns
