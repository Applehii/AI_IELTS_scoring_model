Band 7
The diagram shows the brick-making process. Overall, it includes extracting clay, shaping, drying, firing and delivering bricks.

Clay is dug from the ground and then mixed with water and sand. The mixture is shaped using a mould or roller. The bricks are dried in a drying chamber before being fired in a kiln at high temperatures. Afterwards, they are cooled and packaged for delivery.

[OVERVIEW]
Linear industrial process from clay extraction to delivery.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear steps
• Missing numbers/temperature details
• Could use more linking devices
• Adequate lexical resource
