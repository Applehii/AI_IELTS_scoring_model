[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The diagram describes a rainwater treatment system used to supply drinking water in an Australian community. Overall, rainwater is collected, filtered, treated and then delivered to homes.

Rainwater first flows from the roof through gutters into underground storage. From there, it is pumped into a filtering unit where solids are removed. The water then enters a chemical treatment tank to kill bacteria. Finally, the purified water is directed to households for consumption.

[OVERVIEW]
A four-stage process: collecting, storing, filtering, and treating.

[RATIONALE]
• Logical explanation
• Adequate vocabulary
• Missing some detail (e.g., pipes, valves)
• Limited sentence variety
