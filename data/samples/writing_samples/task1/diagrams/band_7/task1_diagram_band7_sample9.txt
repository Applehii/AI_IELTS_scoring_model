[QUESTION]
The diagram illustrates how solar panels produce electricity for a house.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram describes a home solar panel system. Overall, sunlight is converted into electricity and then supplied to the house through an inverter and control panel.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The diagram describes a home solar panel system. Overall, sunlight is converted into electricity and then supplied to the house through an inverter and control panel.

Solar panels capture sunlight and generate DC current. The inverter converts it to AC power, which is sent to a meter and then distributed throughout the house. Excess energy is returned to the grid.

[OVERVIEW]
From sunlight capture to household distribution.

[RATIONALE]
• Mostly accurate
• Simple vocabulary
• Missing some technical explanation
• Good logical flow
