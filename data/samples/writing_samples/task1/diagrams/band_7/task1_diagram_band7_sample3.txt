[QUESTION]
The diagram illustrates how geothermal energy is used to produce electricity.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram shows a geothermal power system that generates electricity using heat from underground rocks. Overall, the process includes water injection, underground heating, steam production, and electricity generation.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The diagram shows a geothermal power system that generates electricity using heat from underground rocks. Overall, the process includes water injection, underground heating, steam production, and electricity generation.

Cold water is pumped down through an injection well into hot rocks located deep underground. After being heated, the water rises through a production well as steam. This steam powers a turbine, which drives a generator to produce electricity. The electricity is then supplied to the grid.

[OVERVIEW]
A cycle of injecting water, generating steam and producing electricity.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear explanation
• Accurate sequence
• Lacks advanced vocabulary
• Description could be more detailed (temps, pressures)
