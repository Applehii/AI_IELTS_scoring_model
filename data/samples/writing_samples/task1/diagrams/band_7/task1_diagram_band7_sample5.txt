[QUESTION]
The diagram shows how fresh water is produced using a desalination system.

[SUMMARY]
The diagram illustrates a desalination process used to create drinkable water from seawater. Overall, the system removes salt through evaporation and condensation.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The diagram illustrates a desalination process used to create drinkable water from seawater. Overall, the system removes salt through evaporation and condensation.

Seawater is first pumped into a heating chamber, where it is boiled. The steam produced rises and enters a cooling pipe. As it cools, it condenses back into liquid form. This purified water is then collected in a storage tank before being distributed.

[OVERVIEW]
A heat-based desalination process with evaporation and condensation.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear step-by-step explanation
• Slightly short
• Could include temperatures/flow direction
• Lacks advanced cohesion markers
