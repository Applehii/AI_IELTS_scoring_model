[QUESTION]
The table below presents the annual rainfall data for four Asian cities over five years.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

[SUMMARY]
The table delineates precipitation patterns across four geographically and climatically distinct Asian cities, revealing substantial variation that fundamentally shapes regional hydrology and infrastructure requirements.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The table delineates precipitation patterns across four geographically and climatically distinct Asian cities, revealing substantial variation that fundamentally shapes regional hydrology and infrastructure requirements. Manila experiences precipitous annual rainfall averaging 2,500mm, representing more than double Hong Kong's 1,200mm and substantially exceeding both Singapore and Bangkok. The approximately 1,300mm differential between highest and lowest rainfall represents a fundamental climatic divergence dictating regional water management strategies and development trajectories.

The precipitation distribution reflects fundamental geographic positioning relative to monsoonal systems and tropical weather patterns. Manila's equatorial location subjects it to persistent high precipitation throughout the year, whereas Hong Kong's subtropical positioning experiences more seasonal variation with drier periods. Bangkok's intermediate precipitation results from Thailand's geographic position where monsoon influences operate seasonally. Singapore's exceptionally high rainfall despite lower latitude than Manila reflects its unique geographic exposure to multiple weather systems and island precipitation patterns. These climatic patterns constitute not merely meteorological phenomena but rather determinants of agricultural productivity, infrastructure durability, and urban planning complexity.

The consistency of these precipitation patterns across the five-year observation period indicates stable long-term climatic characteristics reflecting permanent geographic-atmospheric relationships rather than anomalous fluctuations. The ramifications extend beyond simple water availability to encompassing flood risk assessment, dam construction feasibility, irrigation requirements, and drainage system specifications. Cities like Manila require substantially engineered flood management infrastructure, whereas drier cities face water scarcity challenges. This precipitation differentiation exemplifies how geographic positioning establishes climatic parameters that fundamentally shape regional development possibilities and necessitate differentiated policy responses.
