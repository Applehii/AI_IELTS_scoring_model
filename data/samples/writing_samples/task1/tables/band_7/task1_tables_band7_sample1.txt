[QUESTION]
The table below shows the number of tourists visiting three countries in Southeast Asia over a 10-year period.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

[SUMMARY]
The table provides comprehensive data on tourist arrivals in three Southeast Asian nations, illuminating marked disparities in tourism development and international recognition.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The table provides comprehensive data on tourist arrivals in three Southeast Asian nations, illuminating marked disparities in tourism development and international recognition. Thailand emerges as the predominant tourist destination, commanding approximately 20 million annual visitors, substantially surpassing both Vietnam and Cambodia by factors of approximately 1.3 and 4 respectively. This pronounced differentials maintains consistency throughout the decade, suggesting structural advantages rather than cyclical variations.

Thailand's overwhelming tourism dominance reflects multifaceted competitive advantages including well-developed hospitality infrastructure, extensive international marketing campaigns, and globally recognized attractions encompassing both cultural heritage and contemporary amenities. Vietnam's intermediate position reflects a tourism sector undergoing rapid expansion, benefiting from increased accessibility and growing international awareness following decades of geopolitical isolation. Conversely, Cambodia's substantially lower figures, despite possessing exceptional cultural landmarks such as Angkor Wat, reveal tourism marketing and infrastructure development disparities that constrain its competitive capacity.

The stability of these hierarchical positions throughout the observation period indicates entrenched structural differences unlikely to shift without deliberate intervention. The approximately 15-million-visitor gap between Thailand and Vietnam persists, suggesting Thailand maintains competitive advantages beyond temporary market fluctuations. For Cambodia and Vietnam to capture substantially increased market share, comprehensive strategies encompassing infrastructure development, international promotion, regional cooperation, and service quality enhancement would prove necessary. The data underscores how tourism development trajectories reflect both historical circumstances and contemporary investment capacity, with Thailand's early dominance creating self-reinforcing advantages through accumulated infrastructure and reputation.
