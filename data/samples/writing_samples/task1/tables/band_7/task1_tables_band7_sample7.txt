[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The table illuminates pronounced geographic and cultural variations in coffee consumption patterns, revealing a fundamental dichotomy between Western nations predominantly consuming 3-5kg annually and East Asian nations demonstrating substantially lower consumption at 1-2kg. Brazil's exceptional consumption at 5kg per capita substantially exceeds all comparative nations, representing quintuple that of China. This geographic stratification reflects deeply embedded cultural preferences, agricultural production patterns, trade histories, and beverage consumption traditions extending beyond simple taste preferences to encompassing fundamental identity and social practice components.

Brazil's exceptional consumption reflects multiple reinforcing factors including its status as the world's largest coffee producer creating agricultural abundance, affordability, cultural integration into daily social practices, and historical consumption traditions. Germany's strong consumption reflects European coffee culture emphasizing social consumption in café settings and morning beverage traditions. The Western nations collectively demonstrate consumption patterns 2-5 times exceeding Asian counterparts. Italy's intermediate-high consumption reflects Mediterranean coffee culture emphasizing quality over quantity through espresso traditions. Conversely, China and Japan's substantially lower consumption reflects entrenched tea consumption traditions, limited historical coffee integration, and potential cultural preferences for alternative beverages perceived as healthier or more culturally appropriate.

These consumption patterns carry substantial implications extending across economic, agricultural, and health domains. Brazil's high consumption supports extensive domestic coffee industries creating employment and export revenues. The consumption patterns suggest limited coffee market expansion capacity in Asia despite growing economic development, indicating cultural preferences prove more resilient than income-based consumption predictions. For coffee exporters and international agricultural organizations, this geographic segmentation reveals distinct market dynamics where expansion requires not merely income increases but rather fundamental cultural beverage preference shifts. Public health implications regarding caffeine consumption and cardiovascular health demonstrate regional variation deserving consideration alongside cultural preferences regarding consumption patterns.
