[QUESTION]
The table below gives information about the average number of cars per household in five cities.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

Hydroelectric is the biggest energy type. Wind is second biggest. Solar is third. Biomass is the smallest. These four types are renewable energies.

The data shows that hydroelectric and wind are the most used. Solar is also important. Biomass is not used much. All of these are renewable. They are good for the environment. More renewable energy is good for the world.
