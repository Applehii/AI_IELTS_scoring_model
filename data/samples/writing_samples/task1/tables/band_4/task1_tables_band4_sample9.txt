[QUESTION]
The table displays the proportion of energy used from different sources in Country X for the year 2010.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

[SUMMARY]
Coal 40%, oil 30%, gas 20%, renewables 10% — fossil fuels dominate; renewables smallest.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 4
The table shows mobile phone users in different regions. Asia has 1.5 billion users. Europe has 600 million users. Africa has 500 million users. Americas has 700 million users.

Asia has the most users because it is very big. Europe has many users too. Africa and Americas have fewer users. Asia is very populated so it has more phones.

The number of users is very different in each region. Asia has much more than other regions. Europe is second. Americas is third. Africa is fourth. This shows that Asia is the largest region. Many people in Asia use mobile phones.
