[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The table presents renewable energy source composition reflecting sophisticated energy system optimization balancing technological maturity, geographic availability, cost trajectories, and policy preferences within climate change mitigation frameworks. Hydroelectric and wind energy collectively constitute 65% of renewable electricity generation, establishing these as dominant technologies through both historical development and contemporary deployment. Solar energy's 25% share demonstrates remarkable expansion trajectory reflecting photovoltaic cost reductions exceeding 90% over recent decades, enabling accelerating adoption despite geographic and weather-dependent limitations. Biomass's minimal 10% share suggests either agricultural waste availability constraints, technological efficiency limitations relative to alternatives, or deliberate policy prioritization favoring less controversial renewable approaches minimizing food security competition concerns.

The renewable portfolio composition reflects multifaceted selection mechanisms encompassing technological maturity, economic efficiency, geographic availability, and institutional frameworks. Hydroelectric power's dominance derives from: established infrastructure investments across centuries, consistently high capacity factors, geographic availability in mountainous regions, and technological maturity enabling reliable long-term generation. Wind energy's substantial contribution demonstrates successful scaling of variable renewable technology through technological advancement improving turbine efficiencies, declining cost trajectories, and favorable geographic conditions in coastal and highland regions. Solar energy's rapidly ascending 25% share represents extraordinary technological achievement wherein photovoltaic costs declining from $3.80/watt (2010) to $0.40/watt (2023) enables economically competitive deployment despite intermittency challenges requiring battery storage advancement. Biomass's constrained share reflects competing demands regarding agricultural waste utilization, technological efficiency limitations, and policy debates regarding sustainability implications of biomass strategies potentially exacerbating food security pressures.

This renewable portfolio composition carries profound implications for climate policy architecture, energy security frameworks, and decarbonization pathway sustainability within climate change mitigation imperatives. The diversification strategy demonstrates prudent risk management wherein excessive single-source reliance creates systematic vulnerability regarding technological disruption, geographic constraints, or policy shifts. However, continued fossil fuel displacement requires accelerating solar and wind expansion combined with energy storage advancement enabling grid stability maintenance. Emerging technologies including advanced geothermal, next-generation nuclear, and green hydrogen production require accelerated development-to-deployment transitions. The portfolio composition suggests policy frameworks successfully balancing technology diversification while enabling emerging technology scale-up, though accelerating renewable deployment timelines proves essential achieving climate targets. Understanding this energy composition proves essential for policymakers designing sustainable energy transitions, investors assessing renewable opportunities, scientists evaluating climate mitigation feasibility within technological constraints, and strategists planning energy security within climate-constrained scenarios.
