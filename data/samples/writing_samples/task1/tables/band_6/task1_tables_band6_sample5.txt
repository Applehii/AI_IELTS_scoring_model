[QUESTION]
The table below shows the number of students enrolled in different university courses over three years.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

[SUMMARY]
The table reveals student enrollment patterns across five university disciplines, demonstrating clear preferences for technical and professional courses. Engineering attracts the highest enrollment with 6,000 students, followed by Science with 5,000.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
The table reveals student enrollment patterns across five university disciplines, demonstrating clear preferences for technical and professional courses. Engineering attracts the highest enrollment with 6,000 students, followed by Science with 5,000. Business programs accommodate 4,000 students, Arts attracts 3,000, while Medicine, despite its prestige and career prospects, has the lowest enrollment at 2,000 students.

The dominance of Engineering reflects contemporary employment market demands and technological advancement priorities. The relatively high science enrollment suggests students recognize career opportunities in research and scientific fields. Conversely, the modest Arts enrollment may indicate declining perceptions of humanities' vocational relevance, despite their cultural importance. Medicine's surprisingly low numbers, despite high social status, likely reflects stringent entry requirements and limited program capacity rather than limited student interest.

This enrollment distribution has significant implications for future workforce composition and educational policy. The concentration in technical fields may lead to skills surplus in technology sectors while potentially creating shortages in humanities and social services. Universities and policymakers must balance market-driven enrollment patterns with broader educational goals and societal needs. Encouraging enrollment in undersubscribed fields through scholarships or improved career guidance could help achieve more balanced professional development across the economy.
