[QUESTION]
The table below shows internet usage by age group in a particular country in 2023.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

[SUMMARY]
The table delineates internet usage patterns across age cohorts, revealing a pronounced inverse relationship between age and digital engagement. Younger demographics demonstrate markedly higher usage rates, with the 15-25 age group utilizing the internet at 95%, while usage progressively declines with advancing age to merely 30% among those aged 65 and above.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
The table delineates internet usage patterns across age cohorts, revealing a pronounced inverse relationship between age and digital engagement. Younger demographics demonstrate markedly higher usage rates, with the 15-25 age group utilizing the internet at 95%, while usage progressively declines with advancing age to merely 30% among those aged 65 and above. The intermediate age groups (26-40 and 41-65) register 80% and 55% usage respectively, demonstrating a consistent downward trajectory.

This data reflects fundamental generational differences in technology adoption and digital native status. Individuals who matured during the internet's emergence have greater fluency and confidence in digital platforms compared to those who encountered the technology during adulthood. The 65-percentage-point gap between the youngest and oldest cohorts represents not merely a usage difference but a substantial digital divide with significant socioeconomic implications. The steeper decline after age 40 suggests accelerating disengagement with digital technologies.

These findings have considerable implications for digital inclusion policy, accessibility design, and service provision strategies. The digital divide manifests as unequal access to online services, information, and opportunities, potentially disadvantaging older populations. Addressing this disparity requires multi-faceted approaches including digital literacy programs, accessible interface design, and infrastructure investment to ensure equitable technology access across all age groups. Understanding these generational patterns is essential for inclusive policy development in increasingly digitized societies.
