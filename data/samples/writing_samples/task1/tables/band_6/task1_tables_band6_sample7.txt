[QUESTION]
The following table shows the coffee consumption in five countries measured in kilograms per capita annually.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

[SUMMARY]
The table presents notable disparities in coffee consumption patterns across five nations, ranging from 5kg per capita annually in Brazil to 1kg in China.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
The table presents notable disparities in coffee consumption patterns across five nations, ranging from 5kg per capita annually in Brazil to 1kg in China. Brazil's consumption substantially exceeds Germany's 4kg by a substantial margin, while Italy's 3kg consumption positions it between the high-consuming Western nations and low-consuming Asian countries. Japan and China demonstrate considerably lower consumption at 2kg and 1kg respectively.

Analysis reveals a pronounced geographic and cultural dimension to consumption patterns. Western nations, particularly Brazil and Germany, exhibit consumption levels that are three to five times higher than their Asian counterparts. This dichotomy reflects deeply ingrained cultural preferences, with coffee occupying different social significance across regions. In Western societies, coffee consumption constitutes a significant daily ritual, whereas in Asian cultures, alternative beverages such as tea traditionally dominate. Brazil's exceptional consumption reflects its status as the world's largest coffee producer, combining both agricultural abundance and cultural integration.

The practical implications of these consumption patterns extend beyond beverage preference to encompass economic, agricultural, and health dimensions. Brazil's high consumption supports substantial domestic coffee production industries, while lower-consuming nations rely more heavily on tea cultivation and distribution. These consumption patterns also influence cardiovascular health indicators and sleep patterns across populations. Understanding these cultural-consumption linkages provides valuable insights for international agricultural policy, global trade dynamics, and public health considerations in diverse societies.
