[QUESTION]
The table below shows the number of tourists visiting three countries in Southeast Asia over a 10-year period.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

[SUMMARY]
The table provides data on tourist arrivals in three Southeast Asian countries over a ten-year period. Thailand dominates the tourism market with approximately 20 million annual visitors, substantially exceeding both Vietnam (15 million) and Cambodia (5 million).

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
The table provides data on tourist arrivals in three Southeast Asian countries over a ten-year period. Thailand dominates the tourism market with approximately 20 million annual visitors, substantially exceeding both Vietnam (15 million) and Cambodia (5 million). Throughout the period, Thailand maintains its position as the region's primary tourist destination, attracting four times more visitors than Cambodia.

The disparity in tourism figures reflects differences in infrastructural development and international recognition. Thailand's well-established tourism sector, featuring renowned destinations such as Bangkok and the islands, likely explains its superior performance. Vietnam's moderate tourism figures suggest a developing tourism industry with growing international appeal. Cambodia's considerably lower numbers indicate it remains less developed in terms of tourism infrastructure and global marketing, despite possessing significant cultural attractions like Angkor Wat.

Over the ten-year period, the rankings remain consistent, with no country significantly altering its position relative to the others. This stability suggests entrenched differences in tourism capabilities among the three nations. For the region to develop more balanced tourism, countries like Cambodia and Vietnam would need substantial investment in infrastructure and international promotion to compete with Thailand's established position.
