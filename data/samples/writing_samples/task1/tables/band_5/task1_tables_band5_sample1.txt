[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
The table presents tourist arrival figures for three Southeast Asian countries over a decade. Thailand attracted the largest number of visitors at approximately 20 million, while Vietnam received around 15 million tourists. Cambodia, as the least visited destination, recorded approximately 5 million arrivals.

Overall, Thailand dominates the tourism sector in this region. The country's consistent high visitor numbers suggest it is a major tourist destination. Vietnam shows moderate tourism activity, and Cambodia's lower figures indicate it is still developing its tourism industry. Throughout the period, Thailand's figures remain significantly higher than those of Vietnam and Cambodia.

The data reveals that tourism is unevenly distributed among these countries. Thailand's popularity may be attributed to its well-established tourism infrastructure. The gap between Thailand and the other two countries remains substantial throughout the entire period shown in the table.
