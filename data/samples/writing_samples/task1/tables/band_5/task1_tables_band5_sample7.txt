[QUESTION]
The following table shows the coffee consumption in five countries measured in kilograms per capita annually.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

[SUMMARY]
The table shows coffee consumption levels across five countries, measured in kilograms per capita per year. Brazil leads significantly with 5kg per person annually, followed by Germany at 4kg.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
The table shows coffee consumption levels across five countries, measured in kilograms per capita per year. Brazil leads significantly with 5kg per person annually, followed by Germany at 4kg. Italy consumes 3kg, Japan 2kg, and China has the lowest consumption at 1kg per capita per year.

Brazil's consumption is notably higher than other countries, being 1kg more than Germany and 4kg more than China. A clear distinction appears between Western countries (Brazil, Germany, Italy) which consume between 3-5kg annually and Asian countries (Japan, China) which consume 1-2kg annually. This suggests that coffee consumption patterns are influenced by regional and cultural factors. The difference between the highest and lowest consuming countries is substantial, with Brazil consuming five times more than China.

In conclusion, coffee consumption varies considerably among these countries. This variation likely reflects differences in cultural preferences and climate conditions. Western nations tend to consume significantly more coffee than Asian nations, indicating distinct beverage preferences across regions.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear identification of major patterns and comparisons. Good use of grouping by region. Attempts cultural analysis. Generally well-organized.

[RATIONALE]
- Identifies regional patterns and makes meaningful groupings
- Uses specific numerical comparisons
- Attempts to explain cultural differences
- Clear introduction and conclusion
