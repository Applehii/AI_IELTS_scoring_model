[QUESTION]
The table below shows the number of students enrolled in different university courses over three years.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

[SUMMARY]
The table shows student enrollment numbers in five different university courses. Engineering has the highest enrollment with 6,000 students, while Medicine has the lowest with only 2,000 students.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
The table shows student enrollment numbers in five different university courses. Engineering has the highest enrollment with 6,000 students, while Medicine has the lowest with only 2,000 students. Science attracted 5,000 students, Business 4,000, and Arts 3,000 students.

A notable trend is the popularity of technical and practical fields. Engineering's high enrollment suggests strong student interest in technical careers. Science, another science-based discipline, received the second-highest enrollment. Business education also attracts considerable numbers of students. In contrast, Arts courses have fewer students, with only 3,000 enrollments. Medicine, despite its prestige, has the smallest enrollment, possibly due to the difficulty of entry requirements.

In summary, technical and professional courses dominate student preferences. Engineering leads significantly, followed by science-related disciplines. Humanities and specialized fields like Medicine attract fewer students. This data indicates current employment market trends influence student course selection.

[OVERVIEW]
