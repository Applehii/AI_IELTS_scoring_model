[QUESTION]
The table below shows internet usage by age group in a particular country in 2023.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

[SUMMARY]
The table illustrates internet usage patterns across different age groups. The youngest age group (15-25 years) shows the highest internet usage at 95%, while the oldest group (65+ years) has the lowest at only 30%.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
The table illustrates internet usage patterns across different age groups. The youngest age group (15-25 years) shows the highest internet usage at 95%, while the oldest group (65+ years) has the lowest at only 30%. Middle-aged groups (26-40 and 41-65) show intermediate levels of 80% and 55% respectively.

A clear inverse relationship exists between age and internet usage. Young people demonstrate significantly higher adoption rates compared to older populations. The 15-25 age group has 15 percentage points more usage than the 26-40 group. The decline becomes steeper as age increases, with those aged 65+ using the internet less than half as frequently as young adults. The gap between the youngest and oldest groups is substantial at 65 percentage points.

The data suggests that digital literacy and internet familiarity decrease with age. This pattern reflects generational differences in technology adoption. Younger generations have grown up with internet technology, while older generations have adapted to it later in life. Understanding these patterns is important for policy makers designing digital services.
