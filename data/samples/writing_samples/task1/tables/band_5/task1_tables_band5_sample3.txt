[QUESTION]
The following table shows the population growth in five countries from 2010 to 2020.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

[SUMMARY]
The table illustrates the population of five major countries. China and India are the most populous, with approximately 1.4 billion and 1.3 billion people respectively.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
The table illustrates the population of five major countries. China and India are the most populous, with approximately 1.4 billion and 1.3 billion people respectively. The United States is significantly smaller with 331 million inhabitants, followed by Indonesia and Brazil with 270 million and 212 million people correspondingly.

The two Asian giants, China and India, clearly dominate in terms of population size. China has a slight advantage over India, though the difference is minimal at just 100 million people. The gap between India and the United States is substantial, with India having nearly four times more people. Indonesia and Brazil, while still large countries, have considerably fewer inhabitants than the Asian nations but more than other global averages.

In conclusion, population distribution is highly unequal among these countries. China and India together account for over one-third of the world's population, while the other three countries combined have a similar total. This demonstrates the significant concentration of population in Asia.
