[QUESTION]
The maps show how a coastal village changed between 1980 and 2020.

The coastal village underwent a comprehensive transformation between 1980 and 2020, shifting from a modest fishing settlement to a modernised seaside destination.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The coastal village underwent a comprehensive transformation between 1980 and 2020, shifting from a modest fishing settlement to a modernised seaside destination. In 1980, the shoreline was lined with scattered cottages and a narrow dirt track. By 2020, these dwellings had been entirely replaced by a continuous promenade with landscaped greenery. The former fishing harbour at the eastern tip was repurposed into a marina that accommodates leisure boats. Inland, the small cluster of houses expanded into a structured residential neighbourhood with paved roads arranged in a grid. A community centre and a retail complex were introduced at the heart of the village, replacing agricultural land. To the west, a new coastal highway was constructed, significantly improving accessibility.

[OVERVIEW]
The period marks a clear transition from a rural fishing village to an organised tourist-oriented town, supported by enhanced infrastructure and extensive redevelopment.
