[QUESTION]
The maps show how a farming area was modernised.

[SUMMARY]
The farming area underwent a strategic transformation. Traditional crop fields were partially retained but reorganised into a more efficient layout.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The farming area underwent a strategic transformation. Traditional crop fields were partially retained but reorganised into a more efficient layout. The old farmhouse in the centre was replaced by a modern processing facility, connected to new access roads. To the east, irrigation canals were introduced, replacing the natural stream. Livestock sheds were removed to make room for a research centre. Large storage silos were installed in the west, optimising agricultural logistics.

[OVERVIEW]
The area moved from traditional agriculture to a technologically advanced farming system.

[RATIONALE]
• Highly technical and accurate
• Clear functional evolution
• Fully meets Band 9 criteria
