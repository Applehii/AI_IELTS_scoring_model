[QUESTION]
The maps show changes in a school between 1990 and 2020.

[SUMMARY]
Between 1990 and 2020, the school underwent systematic expansion. The original single-storey classroom block on the east was replaced by a three-storey academic building, effectively tripling capacity.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Between 1990 and 2020, the school underwent systematic expansion. The original single-storey classroom block on the east was replaced by a three-storey academic building, effectively tripling capacity. The central playground, once occupying a large open area, was reduced and repositioned to the northeast to make room for a new auditorium. The car park to the south was enlarged, and an additional staff parking space was added adjacent to it. The garden area in the west was converted into a modern science wing. Footpaths throughout the campus were widened and realigned to ensure smooth connectivity.

[OVERVIEW]
The redevelopment focused primarily on increasing academic capacity and improving facility distribution.

[RATIONALE]
• Highly detailed, specific transformations
• Elegant academic phrasing
• Excellent precision
