[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The town’s structure evolved profoundly. In 1950, residential areas were concentrated around a single arterial road. By 2020, this road had been expanded into a dual carriageway, linking several newly built neighbourhoods. Farmland to the north was replaced with an industrial park, while the southern woodland was converted into a large public park with walking trails. A new bridge was constructed across the river, connecting the town to emerging suburbs. The old factory in the east was demolished and redeveloped into an eco-friendly business campus.

[OVERVIEW]
The town expanded outward, diversified in land use, and modernised its transport infrastructure.

[RATIONALE]
• Excellent coverage of all spatial shifts
• Deep insight into functional changes
• High lexical control
