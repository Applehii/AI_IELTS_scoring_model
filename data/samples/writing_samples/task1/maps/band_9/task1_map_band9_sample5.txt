[QUESTION]
The maps show how an industrial zone was converted into a residential area.

[SUMMARY]
The industrial zone experienced a complete functional and spatial overhaul. Previously dominated by large factories and processing plants, the area was entirely deindustrialised.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The industrial zone experienced a complete functional and spatial overhaul. Previously dominated by large factories and processing plants, the area was entirely deindustrialised. The factories were removed and replaced by a structured residential community consisting of detached houses arranged along tree-lined streets. A central green corridor was introduced, linking a community centre in the north with a commercial plaza in the south. The railway line was dismantled and replaced by a pedestrian and cycling trail. Additionally, noise-buffer trees were planted around the perimeter to soften the environment.

[OVERVIEW]
The transformation reflects a shift from heavy industry to a sustainable, community-oriented residential neighbourhood.

[RATIONALE]
• Deep and insightful comparisons
• Perfect task fulfilment
• High-level academic structures
