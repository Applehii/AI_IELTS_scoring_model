[QUESTION]
The maps show the redevelopment of a university campus between 2000 and 2020.

[SUMMARY]
Over the two decades, the university campus was substantially restructured. The original main building remained in place but was expanded eastward with two new wings, creating a U-shaped academic hub.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Over the two decades, the university campus was substantially restructured. The original main building remained in place but was expanded eastward with two new wings, creating a U-shaped academic hub. The large car park to the south was relocated underground, freeing space for a landscaped courtyard. The sports field to the west was replaced by a multi-functional sports complex, now connected to the main building via a covered walkway. To the north, the library was modernised, doubled in size, and integrated with a digital learning centre. Pedestrian paths were expanded throughout the campus, while internal roads were simplified and partially pedestrianised to enhance walkability.

[OVERVIEW]
Major improvements occurred in academic, recreational, and mobility infrastructure, resulting in a campus that is significantly more functional and student-friendly.

[RATIONALE]
• Detailed and holistic transformation
• Advanced structures and transitions
• Perfect coherence and accuracy
