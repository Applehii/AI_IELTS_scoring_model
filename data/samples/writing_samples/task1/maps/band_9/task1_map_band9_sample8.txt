[QUESTION]
The maps show redevelopment of a tourist island.

[SUMMARY]
The island was transformed into a structured tourist destination. Originally an undeveloped landscape with scattered palm trees, the area was re-engineered with two separate accommodation zones: beachfront villas along the southern coast and a cluster of cottages further inland.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The island was transformed into a structured tourist destination. Originally an undeveloped landscape with scattered palm trees, the area was re-engineered with two separate accommodation zones: beachfront villas along the southern coast and a cluster of cottages further inland. A circular pedestrian path system was introduced, radiating from a newly built reception complex. To the west, a pier was constructed for boat access, replacing the informal landing area. Green spaces were carefully preserved and complemented with landscaped gardens.

[OVERVIEW]
The development balanced infrastructure expansion with environmental preservation.

[RATIONALE]
• Perfect structural clarity
• Advanced vocabulary & precise mapping
• Excellent overview
