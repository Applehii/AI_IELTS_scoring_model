[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Between 2005 and 2020, the district underwent major commercial consolidation. The small independent shops previously lining both sides of High Street were replaced with a single integrated retail mall spanning the entire block. The outdoor market to the east was removed and redeveloped into a cultural complex comprising a cinema and exhibition hall. High Street itself was pedestrianised, with decorative lighting and seating installed throughout. A new multi-storey car park was constructed to the southwest, complemented by upgraded bus connections.

[OVERVIEW]
The area shifted from fragmented small retail units to a centralised, pedestrian-friendly commercial hub.

[RATIONALE]
• Deep structural reorganisation described clearly
• Excellent linking and comparison
• Fluent, precise, sophisticated
