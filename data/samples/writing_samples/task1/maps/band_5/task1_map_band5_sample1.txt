[QUESTION]
The maps show changes in a small coastal town between 1990 and 2020.

[SUMMARY]
The coastal town became more developed in 2020 compared to 1990. In the past, it only had a few houses near the beach, but later more residential buildings were added.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
The coastal town became more developed in 2020 compared to 1990. In the past, it only had a few houses near the beach, but later more residential buildings were added. A new hotel was also built close to the shore. The main road stayed the same, but a smaller road was added on the right side. The beach area looks improved with some facilities.

[OVERVIEW]
More houses and a hotel were added, and the town became more modern.

[RATIONALE]
• Meaning generally clear but still basic
• Several inaccuracies and vague points (“looks improved”)
• Limited detail and weak comparisons
• Some grammar errors but message understandable
