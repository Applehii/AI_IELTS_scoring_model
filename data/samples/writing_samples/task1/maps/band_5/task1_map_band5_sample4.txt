[QUESTION]
The maps compare the layout of a park in 1980 and today.

[SUMMARY]
In 1980, the park had a big lake and some benches. Today the lake is smaller and there are walking paths around it.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
In 1980, the park had a big lake and some benches. Today the lake is smaller and there are walking paths around it. A café was built in the east, and a playground replaced the old sitting area. The entrance is still in the same place, but the surrounding trees changed slightly.

[OVERVIEW]
More facilities were added and the lake area changed.

[RATIONALE]
• Message understandable with basic coherence
• Some details wrong or uncertain
• Comparisons limited
• Several grammar issues (articles, prepositions)
