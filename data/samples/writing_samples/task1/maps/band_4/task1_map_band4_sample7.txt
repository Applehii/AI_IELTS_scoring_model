[QUESTION]
The maps show the development of a village into a small town.

[SUMMARY]
The village grow bigger. More house, more road, and maybe school.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 4
The village grow bigger. More house, more road, and maybe school. I see also a big building appear on right. Before is empty land now full. The river still same.

[OVERVIEW]
The village expanded.

[RATIONALE]
• Guessing and lack of accuracy (“maybe school”)
• Poor grammar and limited structures
• No clear sequencing of changes
• Missing key details
