[QUESTION]
The maps illustrate how a university campus developed from 2000 to 2020.

[SUMMARY]
The campus change a lot. There are more school and class.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 4
The campus change a lot. There are more school and class. The big field disappear and now have many building. The road is little changed but I think it more wide. The library maybe bigger too.

[OVERVIEW]
More buildings were added.

[RATIONALE]
• Repetitive and unclear ideas
• Guessing instead of describing (“I think”, “maybe bigger”)
• Serious accuracy issues
• Poor sentence structure and limited cohesion
