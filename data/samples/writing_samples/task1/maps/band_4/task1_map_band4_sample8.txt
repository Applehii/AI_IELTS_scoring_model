The maps present changes in a city centre between 1995 and 2015.

[SUMMARY]
City center have more tall building. The car road change a bit but I not see clear.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 4
City center have more tall building. The car road change a bit but I not see clear. There are shopping mall maybe. The small park look remove. Everything is more busy now.

More tall buildings, park removed.

[RATIONALE]
• Very vague statements
• Many incorrect forms (“have”, “look remove”)
• Guessing instead of describing
• No clear comparison of layouts
