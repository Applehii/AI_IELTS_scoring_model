[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The city park underwent notable upgrading between 1990 and 2020. Initially, it featured a large grass field, a pond, and several benches near the entrance. By 2020, the pond had been reshaped into a smaller circular lake surrounded by a footpath. A café was constructed in the northeast, replacing the old seating area, while a playground appeared in the southern part. The main entrance remained in the same place, but additional walking paths were built to improve accessibility.

[OVERVIEW]
New facilities such as a café and playground were added, and the pond was redesigned.

[RATIONALE]
• Well-organised answer
• Sufficient precision and comparisons
• Lacks a bit of advanced vocabulary for Band 8–9
• Some details could be described more specifically
