[QUESTION]
The maps show how a coastal town developed between 1980 and 2020.

[SUMMARY]
The coastal town experienced significant development from 1980 to 2020. In 1980, the area was mainly residential, with a few houses scattered along the coastline and only one main road.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The coastal town experienced significant development from 1980 to 2020. In 1980, the area was mainly residential, with a few houses scattered along the coastline and only one main road. By 2020, the town had expanded considerably. A large hotel was constructed along the shore, replacing several older houses. The main road was widened, and a secondary road was added, linking the residential area with newly built shops to the east. The beach was also modernised with walking paths and a designated recreation zone.

[OVERVIEW]
The town became more developed, with new commercial and tourist facilities.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear structure and detailed description
• Good comparison between past and present
• A few assumptions remain (e.g., “recreation zone”)
• Vocabulary strong but not fully sophisticated
