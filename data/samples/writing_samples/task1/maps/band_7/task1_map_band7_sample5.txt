[QUESTION]
The maps show how an industrial zone was redeveloped into a residential area.

[SUMMARY]

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The industrial zone was completely transformed into a residential area. Initially, it contained several factories and warehouses. By the end of the development, these had been replaced by multiple apartment blocks arranged along a newly built circular road. In the centre of this road system, a public park was introduced. To the east, an additional shopping centre was added to meet residents’ needs.

[OVERVIEW]
Factories were removed and replaced by housing and public facilities.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear, concise, well-structured
• Mostly accurate transformation description
• Could mention more detail about spatial organisation
