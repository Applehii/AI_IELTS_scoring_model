[QUESTION]
The maps illustrate the city centre in 1995 and 2015.

[SUMMARY]
The city centre became more urbanised over the 20-year period. Initially, the park occupied a large area in the east, but by 2015, part of it had been replaced by high-rise office buildings.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The city centre became more urbanised over the 20-year period. Initially, the park occupied a large area in the east, but by 2015, part of it had been replaced by high-rise office buildings. A bus station was added on the west side, enhancing public transport. The shopping street expanded with additional stores, and road improvements were made to manage increased traffic volume.

[OVERVIEW]
More buildings and transportation upgrades were introduced.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear, well-organised description
• Missing some precise spatial info
• Could use more advanced linking words
