[QUESTION]
The maps illustrate the transformation of a small village into a town.

[SUMMARY]

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The small village saw substantial urbanisation during the given period. At the beginning, only a few houses lined a narrow country road. After development, the road network expanded into a simple grid system, allowing easier transportation. Most farmland in the north was replaced by modern housing estates. Additionally, a school was built in the centre, and a small shopping area was introduced to the west, providing services for residents.

[OVERVIEW]
The village evolved into a town with more housing, roads, and public facilities.

[RATIONALE]
• Good coverage of major changes
• Logical sequencing
• Some guesswork remains
• Not fully detailed on directions and locations
