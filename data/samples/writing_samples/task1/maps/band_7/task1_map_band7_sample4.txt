[QUESTION]
The maps show changes in a university campus between 2000 and 2020.

[SUMMARY]
The university campus became significantly more developed over the 20-year period. In 2000, it consisted of a main building, a library, and a sports field.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The university campus became significantly more developed over the 20-year period. In 2000, it consisted of a main building, a library, and a sports field. By 2020, a new science building had been constructed to the west of the main block. The sports field was relocated further south and replaced by a spacious car park. The footpath network was expanded to connect the new facilities effectively. Green areas were rearranged, but the library retained its original position.

[OVERVIEW]
More academic and support facilities were added, improving accessibility.

[RATIONALE]
• Accurate, detailed, well-organised
• Good use of locations (east/west)
• Could include more subtle comparisons to reach Band 8
