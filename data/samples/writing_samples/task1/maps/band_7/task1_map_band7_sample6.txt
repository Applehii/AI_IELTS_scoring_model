[QUESTION]
The maps show changes to a shopping district from 2005 to 2020.

[SUMMARY]
The shopping district became much more commercialised. In 2005, the area had small retail shops along both sides of the main road.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The shopping district became much more commercialised. In 2005, the area had small retail shops along both sides of the main road. By 2020, most of these shops were replaced with a large shopping mall occupying the central area. The car park was relocated to the south, and the former traditional market was converted into a cluster of restaurants. The main street became pedestrian-only, creating a more modern atmosphere.

[OVERVIEW]
The district shifted from small local shops to larger commercial developments.

[RATIONALE]
• Good comparisons and coherence
• Solid vocabulary
• Slight lack of specific map-based detail
