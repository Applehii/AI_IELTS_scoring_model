[QUESTION]
The maps show the changes to a school area over 30 years.

[SUMMARY]
The school expanded noticeably over the 30-year period. A new block of classrooms was constructed to the north, while the playground was moved to the right-hand side.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
The school expanded noticeably over the 30-year period. A new block of classrooms was constructed to the north, while the playground was moved to the right-hand side. The parking area became larger to accommodate more vehicles. The garden that existed earlier was removed to provide more building space. The entrance, however, remained unchanged.

[OVERVIEW]
More buildings were added, and the layout was reorganised.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear but simplistic
• Limited vocabulary
• Missing key details (exact positions, connections)
• Mostly accurate grammar but lacks complexity
