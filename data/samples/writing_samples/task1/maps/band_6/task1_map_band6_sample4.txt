[QUESTION]
The maps compare a park in 1980 with its current layout.

[SUMMARY]
The park underwent several changes from 1980 to today. Originally, it contained a large lake, some benches, and many trees.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
The park underwent several changes from 1980 to today. Originally, it contained a large lake, some benches, and many trees. Today, the lake has been reduced in size and surrounded by walking paths. A café was constructed in the east, replacing the old seating area, while a playground was added nearby. Although the entrance stayed in the same position, the tree arrangement changed, making the park appear more organised.

[OVERVIEW]
New facilities were added, and the lake area was modified.

[RATIONALE]
• Detailed enough for Band 6
• Some descriptions vague (“appear more organised”)
• Minor grammar issues
• Lacks stronger comparison and structure
