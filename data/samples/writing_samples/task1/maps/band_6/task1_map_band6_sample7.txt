[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
The city centre saw considerable growth from 1995 to 2015. In 1995, the area contained a park, several offices, and a few shops. By 2015, many high-rise buildings were added. The park was reduced in size to make space for commercial development. A bus station was built on the west side, improving public transport. The road network was also slightly expanded to handle more traffic.

[OVERVIEW]
More buildings and transportation improvements were made.
