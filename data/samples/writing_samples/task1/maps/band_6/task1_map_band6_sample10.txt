[QUESTION]
The maps show changes in a town centre between 1990 and 2020.

[SUMMARY]
The town centre became more urbanised over the years. Old houses were replaced by office buildings, and the main road was expanded.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
The town centre became more urbanised over the years. Old houses were replaced by office buildings, and the main road was expanded. A roundabout was built at the central intersection. The riverside area was upgraded with walking paths and seating zones. A new shopping centre was introduced in the eastern part, making the area more commercial.

[OVERVIEW]
More offices, better infrastructure, and new public spaces.

[RATIONALE]
• Coherent and mostly accurate
• Still lacks strong comparisons
• Some grammar and structure issues
• Vocabulary range acceptable but not wide
