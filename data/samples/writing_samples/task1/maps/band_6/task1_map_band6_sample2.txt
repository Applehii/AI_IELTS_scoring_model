[QUESTION]
The maps illustrate changes to a university campus between 2000 and 2020.

[SUMMARY]
The university campus became much more modern by 2020. In 2000, the facilities were limited, with only a library, a main building, and a sports field.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
The university campus became much more modern by 2020. In 2000, the facilities were limited, with only a library, a main building, and a sports field. In 2020, a new science block was added, and the sports area was replaced by a large car park. The main footpath was expanded to connect different buildings more effectively. Some green space was also rearranged to create a small garden area.

[OVERVIEW]
More buildings were added and the campus infrastructure improved.

[RATIONALE]
• Contains key information clearly
• Some vague descriptions (“rearranged”)
• Not fully detailed; several features missing
• Grammar adequate but not fully accurate
