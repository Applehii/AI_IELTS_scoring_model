[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
The shopping district became significantly more modern. In 2005, there were many small independent shops, but these were replaced by a large shopping mall by 2020.

Overall, the district became more convenient and attractive for shoppers.

[OVERVIEW]
Small shops were replaced by larger commercial facilities.

[RATIONALE]

• Some vague phrases (“more convenient”)
• Missing details about exact changes
• Grammar competent but still imperfect
