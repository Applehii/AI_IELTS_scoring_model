[QUESTION]
The maps show the redevelopment of an industrial area into a residential district.

[SUMMARY]
The industrial zone was completely transformed into a residential district. Previously, the area had several factories and warehouses.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
The industrial zone was completely transformed into a residential district. Previously, the area had several factories and warehouses. By the end of the period, these were removed and replaced with apartment buildings. A circular road system was also introduced, giving better access to the housing area. In the centre, a public park was created, and on the east side, a new shopping centre was added to serve the residents.

[OVERVIEW]
Factories were replaced by housing and public facilities.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear and detailed description
• Lacks precise measurement or positioning
• Some unnecessary assumptions
• Grammar mostly correct but not fully accurate
