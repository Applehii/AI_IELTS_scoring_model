[QUESTION]
The maps show major changes in a shopping district between 2005 and 2020.

[SUMMARY]
The shopping district became significantly more commercialised. In 2005, small family-run shops lined both sides of The High Street.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The shopping district became significantly more commercialised. In 2005, small family-run shops lined both sides of The High Street. By 2020, nearly all of them had been replaced with a large enclosed shopping mall spanning most of the central area. The former market to the east was converted into a leisure complex featuring restaurants and cinemas. The main road became pedestrian-only, and a multi-storey car park was constructed to the south.

[OVERVIEW]
Small retail units were replaced by larger commercial developments, with improved infrastructure.

[RATIONALE]
• Strong task coverage
• Excellent cohesion
• Minor lack of nuanced phrasing for Band 9
