Band 8
The holiday resort underwent extensive redevelopment. Initially, the accommodation consisted of only small huts, and there was a single swimming pool. In 2020, several new villas were constructed, and an additional pool was added to the east. A restaurant was built near the entrance, replacing unused land. The beach area was modernised with new walking paths and shaded seating. Internal roads were expanded, creating better access throughout the resort.

[OVERVIEW]
Accommodation increased, more facilities were added, and infrastructure improved.
