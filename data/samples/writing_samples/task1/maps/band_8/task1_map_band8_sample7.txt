[QUESTION]
The maps show how a city centre changed between 1995 and 2015.

[SUMMARY]
The city centre saw intensive development. In 1995, the eastern side was dominated by a large park, but by 2015, part of it had been replaced with high-rise offices.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The city centre saw intensive development. In 1995, the eastern side was dominated by a large park, but by 2015, part of it had been replaced with high-rise offices. The western residential blocks were redeveloped into a modern shopping area. A bus interchange was built southwest of the centre, enhancing public transportation. Additionally, the main junction was replaced with a roundabout to streamline traffic flow.

[OVERVIEW]
The centre became more commercial and better connected.

[RATIONALE]
• Complex changes described well
• Good use of transformation vocabulary
• Slightly general in one or two sections
