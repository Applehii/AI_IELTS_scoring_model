[QUESTION]
The maps show the redevelopment of an industrial zone into a residential neighbourhood.

[SUMMARY]
The industrial zone was completely transformed. Initially, factories and warehouses occupied the entire area.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The industrial zone was completely transformed. Initially, factories and warehouses occupied the entire area. After redevelopment, these were replaced by several housing blocks arranged around a newly built circular road. A central park was positioned at the core of this road system. To the east, a small shopping plaza was built, while a community centre was added in the southwest. Trees were planted along the perimeter, giving the area a more suburban character.

[OVERVIEW]
Heavy industrial buildings were removed and replaced with homes and community-oriented facilities.

[RATIONALE]
• Comprehensive description
• Structure logical and well-organised
• Lacks a bit of stylistic sophistication
