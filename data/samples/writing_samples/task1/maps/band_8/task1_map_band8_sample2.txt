[QUESTION]
The maps show changes to a central park over a 30-year period.

[SUMMARY]
Over the 30-year period, the central park underwent extensive modernisation. The original large pond in the middle was reshaped into a smaller circular lake, now surrounded by landscaped footpaths.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
Over the 30-year period, the central park underwent extensive modernisation. The original large pond in the middle was reshaped into a smaller circular lake, now surrounded by landscaped footpaths. The western picnic area was removed and replaced by a café, while the southern entrance was expanded to include a visitor information centre. To the east, the formerly empty lawn was converted into a children’s playground. The northern garden area remained, but it was redesigned with additional pathways.

[OVERVIEW]
Most notable changes include new amenities such as a café and playground, and redesigned water and green spaces.

[RATIONALE]
• Accurate, concise, covers all major changes
• Very good sense of spatial organisation
• Missing only a bit of finer detail for Band 9
