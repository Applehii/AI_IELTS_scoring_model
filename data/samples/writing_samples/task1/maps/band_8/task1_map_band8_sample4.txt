[QUESTION]
The maps show improvements made to a university campus between 2000 and 2020.

[SUMMARY]
The university campus saw considerable expansion. In 2000, facilities were limited to a main academic building, a library, and sports fields.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The university campus saw considerable expansion. In 2000, facilities were limited to a main academic building, a library, and sports fields. By 2020, a new science complex was added to the west, connected to the main building by a covered walkway. The sports field was relocated southward, making space for a large multi-level car park. The library was also extended to the east, and several new footpaths were introduced, creating better internal circulation.

[OVERVIEW]
Academic facilities increased, and infrastructure was reorganised to support higher student capacity.

[RATIONALE]
• Excellent detail and clarity
• Good accuracy with directions
• Could have mentioned reasons or implications for Band 9
