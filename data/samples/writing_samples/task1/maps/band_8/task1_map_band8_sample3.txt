[QUESTION]
The maps illustrate the redevelopment of a village into a small town.

[SUMMARY]
The village transformed dramatically into a small town. Originally, the area consisted of scattered houses along a single rural road.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The village transformed dramatically into a small town. Originally, the area consisted of scattered houses along a single rural road. In the redeveloped version, this road evolved into a structured road network, forming a connected grid. Most farmland in the north was replaced by rows of modern housing. A town square was constructed at the centre, surrounded by shops and a community hall. The southern region, previously unused, became a recreational park equipped with walking paths and trees.

[OVERVIEW]
The village saw major residential expansion, new infrastructure, and community facilities.

[RATIONALE]
• Very clear transformation
• Strong linking of changes
• Limited only by slightly generic vocabulary in some sentences
