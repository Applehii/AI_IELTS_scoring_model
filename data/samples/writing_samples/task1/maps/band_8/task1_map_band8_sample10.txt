[QUESTION]
The maps show how a town centre was modernised between 1990 and 2020.

[SUMMARY]
The town centre became more modern and commercially oriented. In 1990, small houses occupied the northern area, but by 2020, these had been replaced by office towers.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The town centre became more modern and commercially oriented. In 1990, small houses occupied the northern area, but by 2020, these had been replaced by office towers. The main street was widened, and a roundabout replaced the old intersection. The riverside was upgraded with pedestrian paths, benches, and greenery. To the east, a modern shopping complex was constructed, replacing outdated stores.

[OVERVIEW]
The town shifted toward modern commercial development and improved infrastructure.

[RATIONALE]
• Excellent spatial detail
• Very coherent and accurate
• Could benefit from more insightful comparisons for Band 9
