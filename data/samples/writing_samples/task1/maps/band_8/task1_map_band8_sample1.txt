[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The seaside town experienced substantial redevelopment from 1985 to 2020, with a clear shift toward tourism and commercial expansion. In 1985, the coastline was lined with small houses and a narrow local road. By 2020, these residential buildings had been replaced by a large beachfront hotel complex extending along the shore. The main road was upgraded and connected to a newly built promenade. To the east, a leisure centre was added, occupying what used to be open land. The inland area saw further residential expansion, with a new housing estate replacing farmland.

[OVERVIEW]
The town shifted from a small residential settlement to a tourist-focused destination, with significant construction along the coast.
