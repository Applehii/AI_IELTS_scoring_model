[QUESTION]

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The graph illustrates how the proportion of remote workers changed over two decades in three countries. Overall, all countries experienced a clear upward trend, with Country A showing the most pronounced rise.

Country A increased steadily from around 10% in 2005 to 45% in 2020, before jumping to nearly 55% in 2025. Country B followed a similar but less dramatic pattern, rising from 8% to roughly 30%. Country C had the slowest growth, starting at just 5% and reaching only 20% by the end. Although the growth rates varied, remote work became significantly more common everywhere.

[OVERVIEW]
All countries saw strong increases, with Country A consistently leading.

[RATIONALE]
• Detailed comparisons
• Strong coherence and grouping
• Advanced vocabulary (“pronounced rise”, “less dramatic”)
• Clear, logical progression
