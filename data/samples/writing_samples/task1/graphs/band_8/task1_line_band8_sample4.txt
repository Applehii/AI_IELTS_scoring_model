[QUESTION]
The line graph shows the amount of coffee exported by three countries between 1990 and 2020.

[SUMMARY]
Exports rose steadily in all three countries, though at different rates. Country A grew from 1.5 to 3.5 million tonnes, maintaining the highest output throughout.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
Exports rose steadily in all three countries, though at different rates. Country A grew from 1.5 to 3.5 million tonnes, maintaining the highest output throughout. Country B increased more moderately from 1 to 2.2 million tonnes. Country C began at just 0.5 million tonnes but witnessed the fastest relative growth, reaching 1.8 million in 2020.

Although Country C expanded rapidly, it never surpassed the other two in total volume.

[OVERVIEW]
All countries experienced growth, but Country A remained the top exporter.
