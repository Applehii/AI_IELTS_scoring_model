[QUESTION]
The pie chart shows the distribution of greenhouse gas emissions by sector.

[SUMMARY]
Agriculture is the single largest contributor at 28%, followed closely by energy production at 25%. Transport accounts for 20%, while manufacturing and residential sectors contribute 15% and 12% respectively.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Agriculture is the single largest contributor at 28%, followed closely by energy production at 25%. Transport accounts for 20%, while manufacturing and residential sectors contribute 15% and 12% respectively. The dominance of agriculture and energy underscores the need for systemic reform rather than isolated measures.

[OVERVIEW]
Most emissions originated from agriculture and energy.

[RATIONALE]
• High-level commentary ("systemic reform")
• Exceptionally concise but rich style
• Accurate and cohesive
