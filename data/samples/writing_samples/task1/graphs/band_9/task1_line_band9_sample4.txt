[QUESTION]
The line graph shows changes in the number of books published in three countries from 1990 to 2020.

[SUMMARY]
All three countries experienced upward trends in book production, but the scale and pace of growth varied. Country A saw the most dramatic increase, rising from 40,000 titles in 1990 to nearly 120,000 by 2020.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
All three countries experienced upward trends in book production, but the scale and pace of growth varied. Country A saw the most dramatic increase, rising from 40,000 titles in 1990 to nearly 120,000 by 2020. Country B grew more moderately from 30,000 to around 70,000. Meanwhile, Country C, despite starting at a similar level to Country B, rose only to 50,000.

The divergence in growth patterns suggests differing levels of investment in the publishing industry.

[OVERVIEW]
Book production grew everywhere, but Country A expanded far more rapidly.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear discussion of pace + trajectory
