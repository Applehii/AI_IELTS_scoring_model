[QUESTION]
The line graph shows the percentage of elderly people in three countries between 1980 and 2040.

[SUMMARY]
The graph compares the proportion of elderly citizens in three countries over a 60-year period. Overall, all countries are predicted to experience a substantial rise in the share of older adults, with Country A undergoing the most dramatic demographic shift.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The graph compares the proportion of elderly citizens in three countries over a 60-year period. Overall, all countries are predicted to experience a substantial rise in the share of older adults, with Country A undergoing the most dramatic demographic shift.

In 1980, the elderly population in Country A stood at around 10%, but this figure is projected to triple by 2040, reaching nearly 30%. Country B followed a similar upward trajectory, increasing steadily from 12% to approximately 25%. Although Country C started higher at 15%, its growth is more gradual, climbing to only 22% by the end of the period. By 2040, the gap between Country A and the others is expected to widen considerably.

[OVERVIEW]
All three countries will see significant ageing, but Country A’s increase is the most pronounced.

[RATIONALE]
• Sophisticated comparisons
• Highly precise data
• Excellent cohesion
• Analytical, not just descriptive
