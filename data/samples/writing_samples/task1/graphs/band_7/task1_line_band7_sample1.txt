[QUESTION]
The line graph shows the number of commuters using three types of public transport in a city from 2000 to 2020.

[SUMMARY]
The graph compares the number of people using buses, trains, and trams over a 20-year period. Overall, all three modes saw increases, but trains experienced the most dramatic growth.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The graph compares the number of people using buses, trains, and trams over a 20-year period. Overall, all three modes saw increases, but trains experienced the most dramatic growth.

Bus usage started at around 40,000 daily users and rose slowly to about 50,000. Trams showed a steadier increase from 20,000 to 35,000. Meanwhile, train usage rose sharply from 25,000 to nearly 60,000, overtaking buses in 2010. By 2020, trains had clearly become the most popular option.

[OVERVIEW]
All transport types increased, but trains showed the fastest growth.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear comparisons and progression
• Range of linking devices
• Mostly precise language but not highly sophisticated
