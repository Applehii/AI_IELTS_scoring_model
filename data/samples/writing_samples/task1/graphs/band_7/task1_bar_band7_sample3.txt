[QUESTION]
The bar chart compares the average monthly spending of households in four income groups.

[SUMMARY]
Spending patterns varied noticeably across income levels. Low-income households spent the most on food (about $500), while high-income households paid significantly more for entertainment (around $600).

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Spending patterns varied noticeably across income levels. Low-income households spent the most on food (about $500), while high-income households paid significantly more for entertainment (around $600). Housing costs were relatively similar across groups, ranging from $700 to $900. Transport spending rose steadily with income, from roughly $200 to $450.

[OVERVIEW]
Higher-income households spent more on leisure and transport, while lower-income families prioritised essentials.

[RATIONALE]
• Balanced comparisons
• Clear grouping of data
• Occasional lack of detail prevents Band 8+
