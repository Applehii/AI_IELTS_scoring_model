[QUESTION]
The pie chart shows the energy sources used in a country in 2021.

[SUMMARY]
The chart illustrates the proportion of energy generated from five different sources. Fossil fuels made up the largest share, with coal at 35% and gas at 25%.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The chart illustrates the proportion of energy generated from five different sources. Fossil fuels made up the largest share, with coal at 35% and gas at 25%. Nuclear energy accounted for 20%, while renewables represented a smaller part of the mix, with wind at 12% and solar at 8%.

Overall, although the country relied heavily on traditional sources, nuclear power also contributed significantly, and renewables formed a growing minority.

[OVERVIEW]
Fossil fuels dominated the energy supply, while renewable sources remained comparatively small.

[RATIONALE]
• Accurate figures
• Well-organised structure
• Adequate range of vocabulary
