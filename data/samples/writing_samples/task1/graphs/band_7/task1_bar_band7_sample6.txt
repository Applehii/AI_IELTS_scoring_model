[QUESTION]
The bar chart shows the number of books read by adults in four age groups in 2020.

[SUMMARY]
Adults aged 25–34 read the most books, averaging 12 per year. Those aged 18–24 followed with 10.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Adults aged 25–34 read the most books, averaging 12 per year. Those aged 18–24 followed with 10. The 35–50 group read about 8, while people over 50 read the fewest at around 5. While reading decreased with age overall, the difference between the first two groups was relatively small.

[OVERVIEW]
Younger adults generally read more books than older age groups.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear sequence and comparison
• Adequate detail
• Lacks more sophisticated structures
