[QUESTION]
Some people believe zoos are important for wildlife protection, while others argue they are cruel and unnecessary. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

[SUMMARY]
Supporters of zoos argue that they provide safe environments for endangered animals and contribute to conservation programmes. Zoos also educate the public about wildlife protection.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
Supporters of zoos argue that they provide safe environments for endangered animals and contribute to conservation programmes. Zoos also educate the public about wildlife protection. However, critics believe keeping animals in captivity is unethical because it restricts their natural behaviour and living conditions. In my opinion, modern, well-managed zoos play a vital role in conservation, but outdated facilities that prioritise profit over welfare should be shut down.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear ethical vs practical comparison with a reasoned stance.

[RATIONALE]
• Strong analytical depth
• Good balance of arguments
• High lexical diversity
• Precise grammar
