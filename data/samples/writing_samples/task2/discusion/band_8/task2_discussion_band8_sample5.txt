[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
Some argue that technology has reduced face-to-face communication, causing people to become more isolated. They say social media often replaces real interactions, leading to weaker relationships. In contrast, others believe technology connects people across long distances, allowing families, friends, and colleagues to communicate more easily than ever before. Personally, technology can both isolate and unite individuals, but its impact depends on how it is used. Responsible usage clearly contributes to stronger social connections.

[OVERVIEW]
Balanced evaluation of positive and negative impacts of technology.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear distinctions between viewpoints
• Smooth transitions and logical flow
• Advanced vocabulary
• Few minor simplifications
