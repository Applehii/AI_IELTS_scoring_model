[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
Many argue that young individuals should choose their careers independently, as this allows them to pursue their passions and remain motivated in the long term. Self-chosen careers often lead to higher job satisfaction. However, others believe parental guidance is valuable because parents have more experience and can help their children avoid unrealistic or risky choices. I think young people should make their own decisions but consider their parents’ advice as a supportive reference rather than a requirement.

[OVERVIEW]
Well-balanced discussion with a nuanced personal view.

[RATIONALE]
• Mature reasoning
• Precise vocabulary
• Very natural flow
• Minimal grammatical issues
