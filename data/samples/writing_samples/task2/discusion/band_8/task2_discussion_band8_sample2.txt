[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
Many people believe public money should prioritise essential services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, arguing that these directly improve citizens’ quality of life. However, others claim that the arts also deserve funding because they preserve cultural heritage and contribute to a society’s identity. Additionally, creative industries generate employment and tourism revenue. I believe governments should strike a balance: essential services must come first, but consistent support for the arts is necessary to maintain cultural richness.
