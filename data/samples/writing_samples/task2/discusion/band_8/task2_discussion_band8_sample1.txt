[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
Some people believe a university degree is crucial because it equips students with theoretical knowledge and specialised skills that many professions require. For example, careers in medicine or engineering cannot be pursued without academic qualifications. On the other hand, others argue that practical experience is more valuable since it exposes individuals to real work environments, helping them develop problem-solving abilities and adaptability. In my opinion, while hands-on experience is important, higher education remains essential for fields that demand technical expertise.

[OVERVIEW]
Sophisticated comparison of both perspectives with nuanced reasoning.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear, well-developed ideas
• Strong academic vocabulary
• Very high grammatical accuracy
• Insightful and balanced evaluation
