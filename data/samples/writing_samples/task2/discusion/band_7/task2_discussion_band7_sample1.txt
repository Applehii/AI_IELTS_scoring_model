[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Some people argue that starting school early helps children develop academic skills sooner. They believe young children learn languages and numbers more easily, which gives them an advantage later. However, others think children should start school at an older age so they can develop emotionally and socially first. They claim early schooling can create pressure and reduce playtime, which is essential for childhood. In my opinion, while early education has benefits, starting school slightly later may support healthier overall development.

[OVERVIEW]
Balanced discussion with clear development and a reasoned opinion.

[RATIONALE]
• Ideas extended with relevant explanations
• Good range of vocabulary
• Some minor grammar errors but not impactful
• Clear progression and linking
