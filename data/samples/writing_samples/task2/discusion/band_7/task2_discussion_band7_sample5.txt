[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Some people say travelling abroad exposes individuals to different cultures and helps them become more open-minded. Experiencing new environments develops problem-solving and communication skills. On the other hand, others believe online resources, virtual tours, and documentaries provide enough information without the cost of travelling. While online learning is convenient, I think real travel offers deeper and more meaningful experiences that cannot be fully replaced.

[OVERVIEW]
Both sides clearly developed with strong reasoning.

[RATIONALE]
• Mature argumentation
• Good range of vocabulary
• Grammar mostly accurate
• Slight lack of depth in one argument
