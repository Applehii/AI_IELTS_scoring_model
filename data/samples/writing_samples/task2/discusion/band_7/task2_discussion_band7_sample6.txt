[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Many people support free university education because it ensures equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their financial situation. This can create a more educated and productive society. However, others argue that students should pay fees to reduce the burden on governments and to encourage them to take their studies seriously. In my opinion, a mixed system where low-income students receive financial support would be the most effective approach.
