[QUESTION]
Some people argue that globalization strengthens cultural identity, while others believe it erases traditional cultures. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

[SUMMARY]
Those who believe globalization strengthens identity argue that exposure to diverse cultures encourages people to appreciate and preserve their own traditions more actively.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Those who believe globalization strengthens identity argue that exposure to diverse cultures encourages people to appreciate and preserve their own traditions more actively. International tourism and cultural exchange often lead to renewed pride in local customs. However, critics say global brands and media promote a uniform lifestyle that overshadows traditional practices, causing languages, festivals, and crafts to disappear. I believe globalization brings both risks and advantages, but governments can protect cultural heritage through education and community programmes while still embracing global integration.
