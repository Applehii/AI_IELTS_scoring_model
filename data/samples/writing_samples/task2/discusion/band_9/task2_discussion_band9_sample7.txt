[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Advocates of open borders argue that immigration boosts economic growth by filling labour shortages and enriching cultural diversity. They believe multicultural societies are more innovative and dynamic. In contrast, others claim uncontrolled immigration can strain public services, reduce job opportunities for locals, and create social tensions. In my view, controlled immigration is necessary, but policies should remain flexible enough to attract skilled workers and support humanitarian needs.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear exploration of economic, social, and ethical dimensions.

[RATIONALE]
• Deep, multi-layered analysis
