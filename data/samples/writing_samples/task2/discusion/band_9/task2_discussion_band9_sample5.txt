[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Supporters of academic learning argue that subjects such as mathematics, science, and language form the foundation of future careers and global competitiveness. They say schools are primarily institutions for intellectual development. In contrast, others stress the importance of life skills such as financial literacy, communication, and emotional intelligence, which are increasingly essential in modern society. In my view, academic subjects remain vital, but integrating life-skills education ensures students are better prepared for real-world challenges.
