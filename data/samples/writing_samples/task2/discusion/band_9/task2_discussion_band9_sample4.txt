[QUESTION]
Some people think public money should be spent on building new transportation systems, while others believe improving existing infrastructure is more important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

[SUMMARY]
Those in favour of new transport systems argue that modern cities need high-speed trains and smart public networks to reduce traffic and pollution effectively.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Those in favour of new transport systems argue that modern cities need high-speed trains and smart public networks to reduce traffic and pollution effectively. They believe outdated infrastructure cannot meet future demand. Conversely, others say upgrading current roads and railways is more practical and cost-efficient, as these systems already serve millions of people. I believe both approaches are necessary, but investments should prioritise urban areas where modern systems can drastically reduce environmental strain.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear evaluation of competing priorities in public policy.

[RATIONALE]
