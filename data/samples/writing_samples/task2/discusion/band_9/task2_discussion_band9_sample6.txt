[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Proponents of history education claim that understanding past events helps people make informed decisions and avoid repeating mistakes. They argue history develops critical thinking and a sense of identity. Opponents, however, believe history has limited practical relevance, especially in a world driven by technology and innovation. They say subjects like computer science are more valuable for future careers. I believe history remains essential, but it should be taught alongside modern subjects to ensure students gain both cultural awareness and technological skills.
