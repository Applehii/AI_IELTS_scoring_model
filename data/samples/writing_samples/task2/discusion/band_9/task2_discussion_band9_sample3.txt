[QUESTION]
Some people think scientific research should be controlled by governments, while others argue private companies should manage it. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

Some believe governments should oversee scientific research because public institutions prioritise safety, ethics, and long-term benefits rather than profit. This ensures responsible studies in fields like medicine and the environment.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Some believe governments should oversee scientific research because public institutions prioritise safety, ethics, and long-term benefits rather than profit. This ensures responsible studies in fields like medicine and the environment. On the other hand, supporters of private-sector involvement argue that companies are more innovative and efficient, often producing breakthroughs faster due to competitive pressure. In my opinion, a hybrid model is ideal: governments should regulate ethics and safety, while private firms drive innovation through funding and expertise.

[OVERVIEW]
Highly developed arguments with a clear, sophisticated conclusion.
