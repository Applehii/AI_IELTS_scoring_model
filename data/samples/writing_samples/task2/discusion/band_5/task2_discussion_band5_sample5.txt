[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
Some people think learning many subjects helps students have more knowledge. They can understand science, art, and languages at the same time. Others believe students should learn only a few subjects to focus better. For me, I think students should learn many subjects at first, then choose the ones they like later.
