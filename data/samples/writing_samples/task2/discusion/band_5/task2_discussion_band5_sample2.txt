[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
Many people say online learning is good because students can study at home and save time. They can watch videos again when they forget lessons. On the other hand, some think classroom learning is better since students can talk to teachers directly and ask questions. I believe both ways are useful, but classroom learning is better for young students who need discipline.

[OVERVIEW]
Covers both sides but lacks detailed reasoning.

[RATIONALE]
