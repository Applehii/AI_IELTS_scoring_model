[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
Some people believe children should make their own choices because it helps them grow and become independent. They think that choosing small things like clothes or hobbies make kids confident. However, others argue that parents should decide because children are not mature and can choose the wrong things. In my opinion, children can choose some simple things, but parents should guide bigger decisions like study or health.

[OVERVIEW]
Attempts both views but simple and not well developed.

[RATIONALE]
• Limited expansion
• Some grammar mistakes
• Basic vocabulary
