[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Some people believe working part-time helps teenagers gain experience and learn responsibility. They can also earn money to support themselves. However, others say teenagers should only study because working may cause stress and reduce their academic performance. In my view, part-time jobs are useful, but teenagers should choose light work that does not affect their studies.
