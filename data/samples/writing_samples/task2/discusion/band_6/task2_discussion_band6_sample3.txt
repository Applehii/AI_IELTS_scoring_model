[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Some people say libraries are unnecessary now because most books and information can be found online. Digital resources are convenient and quick to access. However, others believe libraries are still valuable because they provide a quiet study environment and free access to books for people who cannot afford them. In my opinion, libraries should continue to exist but also include more digital services to stay useful.
