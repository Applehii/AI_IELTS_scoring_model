[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Many people say teachers help students learn better because they explain difficult topics and guide them. Teachers can also motivate students. On the other hand, some believe self-study is more effective because students can learn at their own pace and use online resources. I think both methods are useful, but students should have teachers for complicated subjects.

[OVERVIEW]
Reasonably balanced and clear.

[RATIONALE]
• Development shallow
• Vocabulary repetitive
• Grammar issues with articles/prepositions
• Needs stronger conclusion
