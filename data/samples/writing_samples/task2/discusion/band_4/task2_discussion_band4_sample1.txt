[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 4
Some people want kids go school early because they can learn more things. They think if start soon then smarter. Other people say children too young and get tired. They should play more. I think early school is ok but not too early because kids need rest too.

[OVERVIEW]
Very short, unclear ideas, no real comparison.

[RATIONALE]
• Grammar errors (kids go school, start soon then smarter)
• Weak development
• No examples
• Ideas repetitive
• Poor cohesion
