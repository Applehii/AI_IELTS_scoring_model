[QUESTION]
School exams are the best way to assess students. Agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I disagree that exams are the most effective form of assessment. While they measure memory and time-management skills, they fail to capture creativity, collaboration, and long-term understanding.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
I disagree that exams are the most effective form of assessment. While they measure memory and time-management skills, they fail to capture creativity, collaboration, and long-term understanding. Project-based assessments and portfolio evaluations provide a richer picture of a student’s capabilities. A hybrid system, combining exams with continuous assessment, is far more accurate than relying solely on timed tests.

[OVERVIEW]
Polished and academically structured.

[RATIONALE]
• Extremely clear critique
• High coherence
• Sophisticated yet concise
