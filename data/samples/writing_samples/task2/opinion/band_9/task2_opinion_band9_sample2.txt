[QUESTION]
Watching TV is harmful to children. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I disagree that television is inherently harmful to children. The effects of TV depend entirely on content and parental guidance.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
I disagree that television is inherently harmful to children. The effects of TV depend entirely on content and parental guidance. High-quality educational programmes can enhance vocabulary, improve cultural awareness, and introduce scientific concepts more effectively than traditional teaching. The real danger lies in unregulated screen time and exposure to violent or commercialised content. Therefore, instead of limiting television altogether, policy and parental efforts should focus on curating programmes and promoting balanced media consumption.

[OVERVIEW]
Nuanced, supported by clear reasoning.

[RATIONALE]
• Extremely clear distinction (inherently harmful vs. misused)
• Excellent lexical resource
• Fully developed argument
