[QUESTION]
University education should be free for everyone. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
Although universal access to higher education is a desirable goal, I disagree that it should be entirely free. Funding free university education through taxes would place an unsustainable burden on working adults, including those who may not benefit from tertiary education themselves.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Although universal access to higher education is a desirable goal, I disagree that it should be entirely free. Funding free university education through taxes would place an unsustainable burden on working adults, including those who may not benefit from tertiary education themselves. Instead, a more equitable model is income-based tuition and targeted scholarships for disadvantaged groups. This maintains institutional quality while ensuring that no capable student is excluded for financial reasons.

[OVERVIEW]
