[QUESTION]
Children should receive homework every day. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I disagree that children should be given homework on a daily basis. While homework can reinforce academic content, assigning it every day undermines children’s need for unstructured time, which research shows is essential for emotional development and creativity.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
I disagree that children should be given homework on a daily basis. While homework can reinforce academic content, assigning it every day undermines children’s need for unstructured time, which research shows is essential for emotional development and creativity. Furthermore, daily homework often becomes a repetitive task rather than a meaningful learning tool, reducing intrinsic motivation. A more effective approach is targeted homework that deepens understanding rather than routine assignments that merely consume time.

[OVERVIEW]
Sophisticated argument with academic reasoning.

[RATIONALE]
• High-level vocabulary (intrinsic motivation, undermine, targeted)
• Exceptional coherence and precision
• Strong academic tone, no grammar errors
