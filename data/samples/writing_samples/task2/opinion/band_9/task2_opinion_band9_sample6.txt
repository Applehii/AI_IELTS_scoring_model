[QUESTION]
Online learning is better than traditional learning. Agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I disagree that online learning is superior to traditional learning. Digital platforms are excellent tools for delivering theoretical content efficiently, yet they cannot replicate the spontaneous discussions, non-verbal cues, and collaborative energy present in physical classrooms.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
I disagree that online learning is superior to traditional learning. Digital platforms are excellent tools for delivering theoretical content efficiently, yet they cannot replicate the spontaneous discussions, non-verbal cues, and collaborative energy present in physical classrooms. Furthermore, online environments magnify inequalities, as students without stable internet or quiet study spaces are placed at a disadvantage. Online education is a powerful complement, but it lacks the holistic benefits required for a comprehensive educational experience.

[OVERVIEW]
Deep analysis of both pedagogical and social factors.

[RATIONALE]
• Excellent lexical choices (spontaneous discussions, holistic benefits)
• Insightful and cohesive
• Near-perfect grammar
