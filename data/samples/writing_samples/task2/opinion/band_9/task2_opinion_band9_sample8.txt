[QUESTION]
Studying art is as important as studying science. Agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I strongly agree that art holds equal importance to science, though they serve different purposes. Science drives technological and medical breakthroughs, while art cultivates empathy, critical reflection, and cultural identity.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
I strongly agree that art holds equal importance to science, though they serve different purposes. Science drives technological and medical breakthroughs, while art cultivates empathy, critical reflection, and cultural identity. A society that values only scientific advancement risks becoming efficient but emotionally impoverished. Therefore, a balanced curriculum that recognises the complementary nature of both disciplines is crucial for producing well-rounded citizens.

[OVERVIEW]
Elegant comparison with philosophical depth.

[RATIONALE]
• Advanced vocabulary (emotionally impoverished, complementary nature)
• Strong, cohesive argument
• High-level academic tone
