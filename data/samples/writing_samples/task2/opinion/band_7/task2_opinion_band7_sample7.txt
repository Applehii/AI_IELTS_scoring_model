[QUESTION]
Some people believe owning a car is essential. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I disagree that owning a car is essential for everyone. In many cities, public transportation is reliable and cost-effective, making car ownership unnecessary.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
I disagree that owning a car is essential for everyone. In many cities, public transportation is reliable and cost-effective, making car ownership unnecessary.

Ultimately, whether a car is essential depends on lifestyle and local infrastructure rather than being a universal need.
