[QUESTION]
University education should be free for everyone. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I agree that higher education should be more accessible, but I do not think it should be entirely free. Providing free university education would give equal opportunities to all students, especially those from low-income backgrounds.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
I agree that higher education should be more accessible, but I do not think it should be entirely free. Providing free university education would give equal opportunities to all students, especially those from low-income backgrounds. However, this policy would place immense financial pressure on governments. A better solution is to reduce tuition fees and expand scholarship programmes so motivated students can still pursue their goals regardless of their financial situation.

[OVERVIEW]
Well-structured with a clear position.

[RATIONALE]
• Strong coherence
• Good vocabulary range
• Thoughtful reasoning
