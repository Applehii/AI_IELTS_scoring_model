[QUESTION]
Some people think children should have homework every day. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I believe children should receive homework, but assigning it daily is unnecessary. Homework reinforces knowledge learned in class and helps children develop discipline.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
I believe children should receive homework, but assigning it daily is unnecessary. Homework reinforces knowledge learned in class and helps children develop discipline. However, giving tasks every day can overwhelm them and reduce their motivation. A more balanced approach is to provide homework only when it meaningfully supports the lesson, allowing children enough time for rest, creativity, and physical activities.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear argument with balanced reasoning.

[RATIONALE]
• Good coherence
• Varied grammar
• Logical explanation
