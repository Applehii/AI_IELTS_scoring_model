[QUESTION]
Some people think school exams are the best way to judge students. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I think exams are useful for measuring academic knowledge, but they are not the best method. Exams create pressure and only test memory, not skills like teamwork or creativity.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
I think exams are useful for measuring academic knowledge, but they are not the best method. Exams create pressure and only test memory, not skills like teamwork or creativity. Schools should combine exams with projects and presentations. This gives a more accurate picture of a student’s ability.

[OVERVIEW]
Good attempt but still not deep.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear logic
• Missing concrete examples
• Grammar errors still noticeable
