[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
I disagree that online learning is better. It is convenient and flexible, which helps people with busy schedules. However, it cannot replace traditional learning because students miss real interaction with teachers and classmates. Also, practical subjects like science experiments cannot be taught effectively online. Therefore, online learning is useful but not superior.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear position but lacking deeper analysis.

[RATIONALE]
• Some complex structures
• Supporting ideas basic
• Argument missing examples
