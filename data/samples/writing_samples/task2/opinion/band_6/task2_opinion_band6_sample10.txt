[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
I think reading books is more effective for learning because it requires focus and helps improve vocabulary. Videos are more entertaining, but people often watch them passively. However, videos can explain difficult concepts more clearly. So both are useful, but reading has more long-term benefits.
