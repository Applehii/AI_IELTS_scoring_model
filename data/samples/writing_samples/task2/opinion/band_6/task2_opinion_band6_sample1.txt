[QUESTION]
Some people think children should have homework every day. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I believe children should have homework, but the amount needs to be controlled. Homework helps them review what they learned at school and build discipline.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
I believe children should have homework, but the amount needs to be controlled. Homework helps them review what they learned at school and build discipline. However, giving homework every day may make them stressed and reduce their interest in studying. Therefore, teachers should give homework only when necessary, not as a daily routine.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear opinion, moderate development.

[RATIONALE]
• Some grammar errors
• Limited supporting examples
• Argument understandable but not deep
