[QUESTION]
Some people think children should have homework every day. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I think children should have homework, but not every day. Homework is useful because it helps them remember lessons, but doing it daily makes them tired.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
I think children should have homework, but not every day. Homework is useful because it helps them remember lessons, but doing it daily makes them tired. Children need time to relax and play. So I believe homework is good in a small amount, not too much.

[OVERVIEW]
Opinion is clear but weakly developed.

[RATIONALE]
• Limited support
• Simple grammar, some mistakes
• Basic vocabulary
• Structure is present but not strong
