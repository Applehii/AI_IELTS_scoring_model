[QUESTION]
Some people think online learning is better than traditional learning. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I think online learning is helpful because students can study anywhere and save time. But it is not better than real school because students get distracted easily.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
I think online learning is helpful because students can study anywhere and save time. But it is not better than real school because students get distracted easily. Also, they cannot practice group work well. So online learning is useful but cannot replace schools.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear opinion, limited reasons.

[RATIONALE]
• Mostly basic language
• Lacks complex examples
• Some variety but still repetitive
