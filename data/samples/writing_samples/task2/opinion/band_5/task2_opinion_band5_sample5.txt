[QUESTION]
Some people think fast food is the main reason for modern health problems. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I agree because fast food has a lot of fat and sugar, so people become overweight and unhealthy. Many people eat it because it is cheap and quick.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
I agree because fast food has a lot of fat and sugar, so people become overweight and unhealthy. Many people eat it because it is cheap and quick. However, lack of exercise is also a reason. So fast food is a big problem but not the only one.

[OVERVIEW]
Basic arguments, partially extended.

[RATIONALE]
• Some coherence but still simple
• Weak depth
• Grammar mistakes
