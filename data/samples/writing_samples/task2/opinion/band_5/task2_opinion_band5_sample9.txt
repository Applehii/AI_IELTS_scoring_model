[QUESTION]
Some people think school exams are the best way to judge students. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
Exams are useful because they show what students learned. But they also make students stressed and do not test other skills like teamwork.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
Exams are useful because they show what students learned. But they also make students stressed and do not test other skills like teamwork. I think exams should exist, but schools need more types of tests too.

[OVERVIEW]
Simple and somewhat balanced.

[RATIONALE]
• Mostly simple reasoning
• Grammar mistakes
• Some cohesion but weak transitions
