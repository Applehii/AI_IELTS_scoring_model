[QUESTION]
Some people believe that watching TV is harmful to children. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I partly agree because TV can be bad if children watch too much. They may not study or do exercise.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
I partly agree because TV can be bad if children watch too much. They may not study or do exercise. But some TV programs are educational and help them learn new things. So TV is not always harmful; it depends on how long they watch.
