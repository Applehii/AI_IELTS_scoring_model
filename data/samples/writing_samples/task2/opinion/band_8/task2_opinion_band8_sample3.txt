[QUESTION]
University education should be free. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I agree that higher education should be affordable, but making it entirely free is unrealistic. Free tuition would widen access, especially for disadvantaged groups.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
I agree that higher education should be affordable, but making it entirely free is unrealistic. Free tuition would widen access, especially for disadvantaged groups. However, it would also impose a substantial financial burden on taxpayers and potentially reduce educational quality. A more sustainable solution is partial subsidies and targeted scholarships, ensuring fairness without compromising standards.
