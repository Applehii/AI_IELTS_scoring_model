[QUESTION]
Children should receive homework every day. Do you agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
I disagree that children should be given homework on a daily basis. While homework reinforces learning, excessive daily tasks can restrict children’s free time, which is crucial for creativity and mental development.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
I disagree that children should be given homework on a daily basis. While homework reinforces learning, excessive daily tasks can restrict children’s free time, which is crucial for creativity and mental development. A more effective approach is assigning homework selectively—when it genuinely strengthens the lesson—rather than treating it as a routine requirement. This balance encourages responsibility without creating unnecessary pressure.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear, nuanced opinion with strong reasoning.

[RATIONALE]
• Precise vocabulary (reinforces, selectively, restrict)
• Well-balanced analysis
• Cohesive and well-structured
