[QUESTION]
Online learning is better than traditional learning. Agree or disagree?

[SUMMARY]
While online learning provides flexibility and accessibility, I do not believe it surpasses traditional learning. Face-to-face classrooms offer real-time interaction and immediate feedback, both of which are crucial for deeper understanding.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
While online learning provides flexibility and accessibility, I do not believe it surpasses traditional learning. Face-to-face classrooms offer real-time interaction and immediate feedback, both of which are crucial for deeper understanding. Moreover, subjects requiring practical experience—such as laboratory sciences—cannot be fully replicated online. Online education is a valuable supplement, but it is not a complete replacement.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear, detailed stance with examples.

[RATIONALE]
• Well-explained limitations
• Good contrast
• Cohesive paragraphing
