[QUESTION]
Why do many young adults prefer renting homes instead of buying them? Is this a positive or negative development?

[SUMMARY]
Young adults increasingly choose to rent homes due to financial constraints. Property prices have risen significantly in many cities, making it difficult for young people to afford a house.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Young adults increasingly choose to rent homes due to financial constraints. Property prices have risen significantly in many cities, making it difficult for young people to afford a house. Renting also gives them more flexibility, especially for those who change jobs frequently or prefer urban lifestyles.
In my view, this trend is mostly positive because it allows young people to save money and avoid long-term debt. However, relying too much on renting may lead to financial insecurity later in life, as people might not build any assets.
