[QUESTION]
Why do many people choose to follow a vegetarian diet? What challenges might they face?

[SUMMARY]
Many people follow a vegetarian diet for various reasons. One common reason is health, as reducing meat can lower the risk of heart disease and obesity.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Many people follow a vegetarian diet for various reasons. One common reason is health, as reducing meat can lower the risk of heart disease and obesity. Others choose vegetarianism for ethical or environmental reasons, believing that it helps reduce animal suffering and carbon emissions.
However, vegetarians may face certain challenges. Some people struggle to get enough essential nutrients such as protein, iron, or vitamin B12. In addition, eating out can be inconvenient because many restaurants still offer limited vegetarian options. Despite these difficulties, vegetarian diets are becoming more accessible worldwide.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear ideas with explanation and some extended reasoning.

[RATIONALE]
• Good control of grammar with minor errors
• Logical development of ideas
• Range of vocabulary (ethical, carbon emissions, nutrients)
• Lacks deeper analysis for Band 8+
