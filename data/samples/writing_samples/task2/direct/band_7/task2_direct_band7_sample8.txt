[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
People prefer online shopping because it is fast and convenient. They can compare prices easily and access a wide range of products that may not be available in local shops. Online stores also offer frequent discounts, which attract more customers.
This trend has a strong impact on local businesses. Many small shops struggle to compete with online prices and may lose customers. As a result, some local stores may close down, affecting local employment. However, businesses that adapt by selling online can still survive.
