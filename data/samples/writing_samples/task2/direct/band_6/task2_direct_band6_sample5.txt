[QUESTION]
Why is it important for children to read books? What problems happen when they do not read?

[SUMMARY]

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Reading books is important for children because it helps them develop imagination and language skills. Children who read regularly usually have better grammar and vocabulary. Reading also teaches them new ideas about the world.
If children do not read, they may struggle in school, especially in writing and comprehension. They might also spend too much time on phones and lose interest in learning. This can affect their future education.

[OVERVIEW]
Reasonable structure, but development remains basic.

[RATIONALE]
• Lacks precise examples
• Mostly simple grammar
• Ideas valid but not deeply extended
