[QUESTION]
Why do some people change their careers later in life? Is this a good development?

[SUMMARY]
Some people change careers because they feel bored with their current job or want a new challenge. Others switch jobs to get better salaries or improve their work–life balance.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Some people change careers because they feel bored with their current job or want a new challenge. Others switch jobs to get better salaries or improve their work–life balance. Nowadays, education is more accessible, so adults can learn new skills more easily.
I believe this is generally a positive development. Career changes allow people to follow their passions and be more satisfied. However, it can also be risky because learning a new job takes time, and not everyone succeeds.

[OVERVIEW]
Logical, clear, but a bit generic.

[RATIONALE]
• Good coherence, limited sophistication
• Occasional grammar issues
• Fairly predictable examples
