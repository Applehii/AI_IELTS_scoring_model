[QUESTION]
Why do many people choose to buy second-hand products? Is this a positive or negative trend?

[SUMMARY]
Many people buy second-hand products because they are usually cheaper than new ones. With the rising cost of living, many families try to save money by purchasing used furniture, clothes, or electronics.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Many people buy second-hand products because they are usually cheaper than new ones. With the rising cost of living, many families try to save money by purchasing used furniture, clothes, or electronics. In addition, buying second-hand items is better for the environment because it reduces waste.
Overall, I think this trend is mostly positive. It helps people spend less and also encourages a more sustainable lifestyle. However, some used products might have low quality or hidden problems, so buyers need to be careful.

Clear explanation, but vocabulary still basic and some points not fully extended.
