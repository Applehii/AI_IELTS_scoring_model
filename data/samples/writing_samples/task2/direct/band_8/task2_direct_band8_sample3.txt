[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
Remote work has become popular because it offers greater flexibility and allows employees to maintain a healthier work–life balance. Many people feel more productive at home without the distractions of a traditional office. Additionally, remote work helps individuals save time and money by avoiding daily commutes.
In the long term, this trend may significantly reshape society. Cities may experience reduced traffic congestion, while rural areas could benefit from population redistribution. However, remote work may weaken workplace relationships and reduce innovation if collaboration becomes limited.

[OVERVIEW]
Good evaluation of both benefits and consequences.

[RATIONALE]
• High-level vocabulary (redistribution, collaboration)
• Strong coherence
• Some ideas could be more detailed
