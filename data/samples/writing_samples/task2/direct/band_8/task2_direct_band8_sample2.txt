[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
Many people choose higher education to secure better career prospects and enjoy greater social mobility. Degrees are often viewed as a pathway to stable employment and higher income. Additionally, universities allow students to develop specialised knowledge and critical thinking skills that are valuable in many professions.
However, when too many people obtain degrees, several problems can occur. Job markets may become saturated, leading to fierce competition and underemployment. Moreover, employers may start demanding even higher qualifications, creating unnecessary pressure on young people. This overemphasis on degrees can also reduce the value of vocational training.
