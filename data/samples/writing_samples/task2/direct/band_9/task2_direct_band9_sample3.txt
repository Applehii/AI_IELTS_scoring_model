[QUESTION]
Why are people becoming more interested in sustainable living? What actions can governments take to support this?

[SUMMARY]
Interest in sustainable living has grown largely because environmental degradation is no longer an abstract concern but an observable reality.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Interest in sustainable living has grown largely because environmental degradation is no longer an abstract concern but an observable reality. Climate change, plastic pollution, and declining biodiversity have made individuals more conscious of their ecological footprint. Additionally, widespread access to information has heightened public awareness about the long-term consequences of unsustainable consumption.
Governments can support this trend by implementing strong environmental regulations, offering tax incentives for eco-friendly products, and investing in renewable energy infrastructure. Public education campaigns can further encourage sustainable habits, while improved public transport can reduce dependency on private vehicles. When government policies align with individual efforts, sustainable living becomes far more achievable.

[OVERVIEW]
Strategic, well-evidenced, and cohesive.

[RATIONALE]
• Complex, multi-layered analysis
• High-level vocabulary (ecological footprint, infrastructure)
• Clear and precise solutions
