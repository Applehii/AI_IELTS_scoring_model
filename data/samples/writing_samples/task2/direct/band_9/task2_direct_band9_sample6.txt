[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
People relocate to major cities for better employment prospects, educational opportunities, and a wider range of cultural experiences. Urban areas often provide more specialised industries and higher salaries, which attract ambitious professionals. Additionally, the diversity and vibrancy of cities appeal to those seeking personal growth and social exposure.
Despite these advantages, city life presents notable challenges. High living costs, overcrowding, and long commutes can quickly erode quality of life. Moreover, the fast-paced environment may lead to feelings of isolation or stress. Relocating to a major city is therefore a trade-off between opportunity and well-being.
