[QUESTION]
Why do some people choose to delay marriage? What effects does this have on society?

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Many individuals delay marriage due to shifting social values and greater career ambitions. Compared to previous generations, young adults today prioritise financial stability, personal development, and educational goals before committing to long-term relationships. Furthermore, modern society places less pressure on early marriage, giving people the freedom to make decisions based on readiness rather than tradition.
The societal impact of delayed marriage is multifaceted. On one hand, it often leads to more stable relationships because partners enter marriage with greater maturity and financial security. On the other hand, declining birth rates may place pressure on social welfare systems in ageing countries. Overall, the trend reflects a broader cultural shift toward autonomy and individual choice.
