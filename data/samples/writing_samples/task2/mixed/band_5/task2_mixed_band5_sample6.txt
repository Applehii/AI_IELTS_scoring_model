[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
Short online courses are popular because they are cheap and convenient. People can study anytime and anywhere. This is effective for learning simple skills, but not good for subjects that need practice or group work. I think online courses are helpful, but they cannot replace traditional classes.

Moderate clarity but limited detail.
