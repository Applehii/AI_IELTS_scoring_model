[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
Part-time work is popular because people want more free time. Students also choose part-time to balance study and work. This trend is positive because it gives flexibility, but it can be negative when people cannot earn enough money. In my opinion, part-time work is useful in some situations.

[OVERVIEW]
Some development but too general.
