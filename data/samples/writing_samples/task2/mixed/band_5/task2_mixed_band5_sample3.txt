[QUESTION]
Many people choose to live alone today. Why is this the case? Is this a positive or negative trend?

[SUMMARY]
More people live alone because they want independence. They can decide their schedule and lifestyle.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
More people live alone because they want independence. They can decide their schedule and lifestyle. Also, people earn more money now, so they can afford their own place. This can be positive for personal freedom, but it is negative when people feel lonely or stressed. I think the impact depends on the person.

[OVERVIEW]
Balanced view but lacks depth.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear structure
• Limited detail and analysis
• Several grammar issues
• Vocab repetitive (positive/negative)
