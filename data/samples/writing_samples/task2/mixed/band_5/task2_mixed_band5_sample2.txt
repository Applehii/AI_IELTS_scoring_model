[QUESTION]
More young people are choosing to start their own businesses rather than work for companies. Why is this happening? Do you think this is a good idea?

[SUMMARY]
Young people start businesses because they want more freedom and do not like strict company rules. They also see successful entrepreneurs online and want the same lifestyle.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
Young people start businesses because they want more freedom and do not like strict company rules. They also see successful entrepreneurs online and want the same lifestyle. This can be a good idea because they can learn a lot, but it is also risky if they have no experience. In my opinion, it is good only when they prepare well.

[OVERVIEW]
Some expansion but still too general.

[RATIONALE]
• Some clear arguments
• Vocabulary functional but simple
• Grammar errors reduce precision
• Lacks supporting examples
