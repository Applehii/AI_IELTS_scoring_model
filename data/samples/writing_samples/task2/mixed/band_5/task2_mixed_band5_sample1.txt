[QUESTION]
Many people are eating less home-cooked food nowadays. Why is this happening? Is this a positive or negative development?

[SUMMARY]
People eat less home-cooked food because life is becoming busier. Many workers do not have time to cook, so they choose restaurants or fast food.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
People eat less home-cooked food because life is becoming busier. Many workers do not have time to cook, so they choose restaurants or fast food. This can save time, but it is often unhealthy. I think this trend is mostly negative because people lose healthy eating habits and family meals become less common.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear ideas but limited explanation.

[RATIONALE]
• Simple but understandable reasons
• Some development but not detailed
