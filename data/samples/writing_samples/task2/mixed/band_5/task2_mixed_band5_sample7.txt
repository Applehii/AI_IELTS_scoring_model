[QUESTION]
Many people prefer renting houses instead of buying them. Why is this the case? Do you think it is a good choice?

[SUMMARY]
People rent houses because buying is too expensive. Young people especially cannot afford a big loan.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
People rent houses because buying is too expensive. Young people especially cannot afford a big loan. Renting also gives more flexibility because they can move easily. This is good for people who move a lot, but renting long-term can waste money. I think renting is fine when people are not ready to buy.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear reasons but limited development.

[RATIONALE]
• Coherent basic structure
• Vocab repetitive
• No real examples or explanation depth
• Some grammar mistakes
