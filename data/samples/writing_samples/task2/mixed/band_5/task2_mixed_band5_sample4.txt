[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
People change jobs because they want better salary or new experiences. Sometimes they are not happy with their boss or coworkers. Changing jobs can be good because they can learn more skills, but too many changes make life unstable. I think people should change jobs only when they have a clear reason.

[OVERVIEW]
Reasonable ideas but lacks examples.

[RATIONALE]
• Understandable explanations
• Weak development
• Some structural variety
• Frequent grammar mistakes
