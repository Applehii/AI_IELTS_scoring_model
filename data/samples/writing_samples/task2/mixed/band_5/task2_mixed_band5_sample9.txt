[QUESTION]
Many people prefer using public transport instead of driving. Why is this happening? Is this a positive trend?

[SUMMARY]
People use public transport because it is cheaper than having a car. It also helps reduce traffic and pollution.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
People use public transport because it is cheaper than having a car. It also helps reduce traffic and pollution. This is a positive trend because cities become cleaner. But sometimes public transport is crowded and slow. Overall, I think it is more positive than negative.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear but simplistic argument.

[RATIONALE]
• Fair coherence
• Vocabulary limited
• No deeper analysis
• Several grammar slips
