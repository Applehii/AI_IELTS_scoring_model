[QUESTION]
More people are choosing part-time work. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or negative trend?

[SUMMARY]
Part-time work is rising because people want more time for personal life or study. Students choose part-time jobs to gain experience, while parents may do it to care for their children.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Part-time work is rising because people want more time for personal life or study. Students choose part-time jobs to gain experience, while parents may do it to care for their children. This trend gives flexibility, but it might lead to lower income and fewer benefits. I think it is positive for those who prioritise balance, but not ideal for people who need stable earnings.

[OVERVIEW]
Reasonable analysis but not deep.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear points but somewhat repetitive
• Moderate grammar errors
• Adequate cohesion
• Needs more sophistication
