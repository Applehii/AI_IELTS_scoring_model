[QUESTION]
Some people prefer renting a home instead of buying one. Why is this happening? Do you think this is a good choice?

[SUMMARY]
Renting has become more common because property prices are increasing and many people cannot afford a mortgage. Renting also offers flexibility, as people can move easily for work.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Renting has become more common because property prices are increasing and many people cannot afford a mortgage. Renting also offers flexibility, as people can move easily for work. However, renters do not build long-term assets and may face unstable rent prices. I believe renting is suitable for young adults or people who move frequently, but buying is better for long-term financial security.

[OVERVIEW]
Balanced, reasonably detailed discussion.

[RATIONALE]
• Good structure and progression
• Vocabulary adequate but not advanced
• Minor grammatical mistakes
• Could add more supporting detail
