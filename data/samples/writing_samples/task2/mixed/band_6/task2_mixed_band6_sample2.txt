[QUESTION]
More young people are choosing to take a gap year before university. Why is this happening? Do you think it is a good idea?

[SUMMARY]
Many young people take a gap year because they want real-life experience before continuing their studies. Some work to save money, while others travel to learn about new cultures.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Many young people take a gap year because they want real-life experience before continuing their studies. Some work to save money, while others travel to learn about new cultures. This can help them understand what they want to study in university. However, a gap year can also be risky if students lose motivation or spend too much money. Personally, I believe it is beneficial as long as they have a clear plan and purpose.

[OVERVIEW]
Reasonably balanced discussion with a practical viewpoint.

[RATIONALE]
• Good explanation of reasons
• Balanced evaluation
• Some awkward phrasing and grammar issues
• Lacks more detailed examples
