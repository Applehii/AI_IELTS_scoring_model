[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Online shopping has become more common mainly because it is convenient. People can compare prices, read reviews, and receive items quickly without leaving home. Another reason is that online stores often offer more options than local shops. Although this trend saves time and can help customers make better choices, it may negatively affect small businesses that cannot compete. Overall, I think it is mostly positive, but governments should support local shops to maintain balance.
