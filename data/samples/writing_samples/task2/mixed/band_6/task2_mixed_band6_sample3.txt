[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Working from home is becoming popular because technology allows people to communicate and complete tasks without being in the office. It also saves time and money that would be spent on commuting. This arrangement can improve work-life balance, but it may reduce social interaction and teamwork. In my opinion, it is positive for people who can manage their time well, but companies should still organise regular meetings to maintain communication.
