[QUESTION]
More young people are choosing to take a gap year before university. Why is this happening? Do you think it is a good idea?

[SUMMARY]
A growing number of students take a gap year because they want real-world experience before committing to a major. Many travel to broaden their perspectives, while others take internships to explore career paths.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
A growing number of students take a gap year because they want real-world experience before committing to a major. Many travel to broaden their perspectives, while others take internships to explore career paths. Financial pressure is also a factor, as part-time work helps students pay tuition fees later.
In my view, a gap year is beneficial if structured carefully. It gives students maturity and clearer academic goals. However, without planning, it can become unproductive or financially stressful.
