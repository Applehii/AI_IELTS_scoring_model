[QUESTION]
Some people prefer renting a home instead of buying. Why is this happening? Do you think it is a good choice?

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
The rise in renting is mainly due to soaring housing prices. Many young adults cannot afford a down payment, so renting becomes the only realistic option. Additionally, renting provides flexibility for people who move frequently for work.
I think renting is suitable for early career individuals because it reduces financial pressure. However, in the long run, buying a home provides stability and can be a good investment.
