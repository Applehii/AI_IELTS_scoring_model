[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Part-time work is becoming common due to lifestyle changes. Many people seek more personal time for hobbies, childcare, or study. Companies also hire part-time workers to reduce labour costs.
This trend offers flexibility and reduces burnout, but it may result in lower income and fewer career opportunities. I believe it is mostly positive for individuals with clear priorities, but not ideal for long-term career advancement.

[OVERVIEW]
Balanced, clearly explained points.

[RATIONALE]
• Good vocabulary
• Addresses both parts well
• Development could be a bit deeper
• Fit Band 7 criteria
