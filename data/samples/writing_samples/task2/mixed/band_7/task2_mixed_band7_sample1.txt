[QUESTION]
Many people today prefer to shop online rather than in physical stores. Why is this happening? Is this a positive or negative development?

[SUMMARY]
Online shopping has grown rapidly because it offers greater convenience than traditional retail. Customers can browse thousands of products, compare prices instantly, and receive items within a few days.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Online shopping has grown rapidly because it offers greater convenience than traditional retail. Customers can browse thousands of products, compare prices instantly, and receive items within a few days. Additionally, digital payment systems have become more secure, making people feel comfortable purchasing online.
Although this trend supports consumer choice and saves time, it also contributes to the decline of local businesses and increases packaging waste. Overall, I believe online shopping is positive if governments regulate waste and support small retailers to adapt.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear reasons + thoughtful evaluation + balanced viewpoint.

[RATIONALE]
• Well-developed ideas with explanations
• Higher lexical precision (“secure payment systems”, “consumer choice”)
• Minor grammar issues but message stays strong
• Good balance of pros/cons
