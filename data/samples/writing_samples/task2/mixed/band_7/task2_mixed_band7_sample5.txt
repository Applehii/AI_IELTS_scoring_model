[QUESTION]
Many people buy second-hand items online. Why is this happening? Is this a positive or negative development?

[SUMMARY]
Buying used items online has become common because it is more affordable and environmentally friendly. Digital marketplaces provide secure payment systems and clear seller ratings, which increase trust.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Buying used items online has become common because it is more affordable and environmentally friendly. Digital marketplaces provide secure payment systems and clear seller ratings, which increase trust.
This trend helps reduce waste and allows low-income families to access products they otherwise could not afford. However, some items may be damaged or unsafe. Overall, I consider it positive as long as platforms enforce stricter product checks.

[OVERVIEW]
Cause + benefit + drawback with reasonable depth.

[RATIONALE]
• Good balance
• Expanded reasoning (“secure payment systems”, “trust”)
• Light grammar slips possible
• Approaches Band 8 in clarity
