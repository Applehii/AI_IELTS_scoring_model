People choose online courses because they allow flexible schedules and can be accessed from anywhere. Many platforms also offer certificates at a lower cost than universities.
Online learning is effective for theory-based subjects, especially for self-motivated learners. However, it may be less suitable for practical fields such as laboratory sciences. In general, I believe online learning is a valuable supplement but should not completely replace traditional education.
