[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
A growing number of individuals now opt to live alone, mainly due to rising financial independence and shifting cultural attitudes. Young adults, particularly professionals in urban areas, increasingly prioritise privacy and flexible lifestyles that shared accommodation cannot provide. Moreover, technological advances have made remote social interaction easier, reducing the psychological barriers traditionally associated with solo living.
This trend is largely positive. Living alone fosters self-discipline, financial responsibility, and emotional maturity. However, it can lead to isolation for those lacking strong social networks. With adequate community engagement, the advantages are substantial and outweigh the potential drawbacks.
