[QUESTION]
More people are delaying marriage. What are the reasons? Is this a positive or negative development?

Delayed marriage is primarily due to career prioritisation and the rising cost of living. Many adults now focus on establishing financial security before committing to long-term relationships.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Delayed marriage is primarily due to career prioritisation and the rising cost of living. Many adults now focus on establishing financial security before committing to long-term relationships. Social norms have also evolved, reducing pressure to marry early.
This trend is generally positive. Marrying later can lead to more stable, mature partnerships. However, governments may need to address potential demographic consequences, such as lower birth rates.

[OVERVIEW]
Deep socio-economic reasoning + nuanced evaluation.

[RATIONALE]
• Very strong coherence
• Rich vocabulary
• Balanced, thoughtful judgement
