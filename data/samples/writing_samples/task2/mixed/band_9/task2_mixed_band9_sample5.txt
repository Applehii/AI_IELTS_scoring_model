[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Increasing globalisation and the accessibility of international qualifications have motivated students to study overseas. Foreign institutions often provide advanced research facilities and culturally diverse environments that broaden students’ perspectives.
This trend is highly positive. Students gain independence, intercultural competence, and global career prospects. Although the financial burden can be substantial, scholarships and exchange programmes help mitigate these costs, making the overall impact beneficial.

[OVERVIEW]
Cause explained with globalisation logic + strong benefits.

[RATIONALE]
• Excellent vocabulary (“intercultural competence”)
• Clear justification
• High-level cohesion
