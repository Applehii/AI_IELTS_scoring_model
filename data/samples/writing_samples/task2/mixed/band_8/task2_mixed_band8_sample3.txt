[QUESTION]
Many people switch jobs several times during their careers. Why is this happening? Is this a positive or negative trend?

[SUMMARY]
Job switching has become common because modern labour markets evolve rapidly. Employees must adapt to new technologies, and changing jobs allows them to gain diverse experience and negotiate better salaries.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
Job switching has become common because modern labour markets evolve rapidly. Employees must adapt to new technologies, and changing jobs allows them to gain diverse experience and negotiate better salaries.
This trend is generally positive since it encourages professional growth and prevents stagnation. Nevertheless, frequent transitions may create instability and reduce long-term commitment. Despite this, the overall impact is beneficial when individuals switch strategically rather than impulsively.

[OVERVIEW]
Cause explained deeply + sophisticated evaluation.

[RATIONALE]
• Strong reasoning with nuanced insight
• Excellent vocabulary (“labour markets evolve”, “professional growth”, “stagnation”)
• High coherence and precision
