[QUESTION]
A growing number of people are working internationally. What causes this? Is it a positive or negative trend?

This trend is mostly positive because it promotes cultural exchange and helps individuals develop advanced skills. However, it can contribute to brain drain in developing nations. Despite this drawback, international mobility benefits both workers and global industries.
