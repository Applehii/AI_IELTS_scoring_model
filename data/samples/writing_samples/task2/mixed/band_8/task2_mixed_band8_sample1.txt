[QUESTION]
Many people today choose to live alone. Why is this happening? Is this a positive or negative development?

[SUMMARY]
More people are choosing to live alone due to rising financial independence and lifestyle preferences. Young professionals often move to large cities for work, where living alone gives them privacy and flexibility.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
More people are choosing to live alone due to rising financial independence and lifestyle preferences. Young professionals often move to large cities for work, where living alone gives them privacy and flexibility. Social norms have also shifted, making solo living more acceptable.
In my opinion, this trend is largely positive because it allows individuals to develop self-reliance and personal space. However, it can become negative when it leads to social isolation or higher living expenses. With proper community support, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

[OVERVIEW]
Clear causes + nuanced evaluation + strong balance.

[RATIONALE]
• Developed arguments with sophistication
• Advanced vocabulary (“financial independence”, “social norms shifted”)
• High coherence and control
• Light errors may appear but not frequent
