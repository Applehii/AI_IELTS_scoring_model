[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Plastic waste damages the environment in many ways. First, it pollutes oceans and harms sea animals that may eat plastic pieces. Second, plastic takes many years to break down, so it stays in landfills for a long time. To solve this, governments should ban single-use plastic items like straws and bags. People should also recycle more and choose products with eco-friendly packaging. With these actions, plastic waste can be reduced.

[OVERVIEW]
Plastic harms oceans; banning and recycling are solutions.

[RATIONALE]
