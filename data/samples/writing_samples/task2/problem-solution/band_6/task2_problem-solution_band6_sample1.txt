[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Traffic congestion causes several issues in big cities. One major problem is that people spend too much time on the road, which reduces productivity and increases stress. Another issue is air pollution, as cars release harmful gases while moving slowly. To solve this, governments could improve public transport to make it more convenient and cheaper. Another solution is building more bike lanes to encourage people to use bicycles. If these actions are taken, traffic could become less heavy.

[OVERVIEW]
Congestion wastes time and causes pollution; improve transport and bike lanes.
