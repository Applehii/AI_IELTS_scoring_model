[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
Excessive smartphone use among children has created both developmental and social concerns. One significant problem is impaired attention span. Children who are constantly exposed to fast-paced digital content often struggle to concentrate on academic tasks, which negatively affects their long-term learning abilities. Another issue is reduced face-to-face interaction. When children rely heavily on online entertainment, they have fewer opportunities to develop social skills, leading to communication difficulties later in life.
To address these issues, parents should establish strict screen-time limits and introduce alternative activities such as outdoor play or reading. Schools can also implement digital-wellbeing lessons to help students understand the risks of overuse. By combining parental guidance with school-based education, children can develop healthier digital habits.

[OVERVIEW]
Excessive screen time harms focus and social skills; parental limits and school education are effective solutions.

[RATIONALE]
• Deep explanation of problems
• Sophisticated vocabulary and clear structure
• Solutions are practical and strongly linked to causes
