Modern stress is largely caused by demanding work schedules and constant digital connectivity. Many employees struggle to disconnect from work emails and messages, resulting in persistent mental pressure. Financial burdens, such as rising living costs, further intensify stress levels.
To overcome this, workplaces could establish clear boundaries by discouraging after-hours communication. Governments can also provide financial counselling services to help people manage expenses more effectively. These measures would help individuals lead more balanced and stable lives.

[OVERVIEW]
Stress comes from overwork and financial pressure; boundaries and financial support help.
