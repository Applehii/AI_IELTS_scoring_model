[QUESTION]
Public transportation is underused in many cities. What problems does this create and what solutions could encourage greater use?

[SUMMARY]
When public transport is underused, roads become more congested, increasing travel times and pollution. It also means cities waste money maintaining transport systems that few people rely on.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
When public transport is underused, roads become more congested, increasing travel times and pollution. It also means cities waste money maintaining transport systems that few people rely on.
To boost usage, governments should improve service reliability and cleanliness. Offering discounted monthly passes or integrating multiple transport modes into one system could also attract more passengers. These measures would make public transport more appealing.

[OVERVIEW]
Low usage increases congestion and wastes funds; better service and incentives help.

[RATIONALE]
• Strong coherence
• Good range of ideas
• Could include more depth
