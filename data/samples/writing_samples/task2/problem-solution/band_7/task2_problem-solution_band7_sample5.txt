[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Poor financial management can trap young people in long-term debt and prevent them from saving for important life events, such as buying a house. It can also create stress and strain relationships if people overspend and cannot meet financial commitments.
A viable solution is to introduce financial literacy classes in high school, teaching budgeting and responsible use of credit cards. Banks could also provide beginner-friendly financial tools, such as spending alerts or saving incentives. These approaches would help young adults develop healthier financial habits.

[OVERVIEW]
Poor money management leads to debt and stress; education and banking tools can help.

[RATIONALE]
