[QUESTION]
Food waste is a growing global problem. What causes this and what solutions can be taken?

[SUMMARY]
Food waste occurs when consumers buy more than they need or when supermarkets reject items for minor imperfections. This leads to unnecessary use of natural resources and increases landfill waste.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Food waste occurs when consumers buy more than they need or when supermarkets reject items for minor imperfections. This leads to unnecessary use of natural resources and increases landfill waste.
To solve this, supermarkets should donate unsold but edible food to charities. Governments could also run educational campaigns teaching people how to store food properly and plan meals. These steps would significantly reduce waste.

[OVERVIEW]
Food waste wastes resources; donations and education are key solutions.

[RATIONALE]
• Clear, well-developed explanations
• Good vocabulary range
• Not enough complexity for band 8–9
