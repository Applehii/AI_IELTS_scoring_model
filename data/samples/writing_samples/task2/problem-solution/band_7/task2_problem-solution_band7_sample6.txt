[QUESTION]
The rise of fast fashion has created environmental problems. What are the issues and how can they be solved?

[SUMMARY]
Fast fashion contributes heavily to pollution. Factories producing cheap clothing often release toxic chemicals into rivers, while huge amounts of textile waste end up in landfills.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Fast fashion contributes heavily to pollution. Factories producing cheap clothing often release toxic chemicals into rivers, while huge amounts of textile waste end up in landfills. Additionally, constant consumption encourages a throwaway culture.
Governments could impose stricter regulations on manufacturing processes, requiring companies to treat wastewater properly. Consumers should also be encouraged to buy fewer but higher-quality items through awareness campaigns. Together, these actions would reduce the environmental damage caused by fast fashion.

[OVERVIEW]
Fast fashion pollutes and creates waste; regulations and awareness reduce the problem.

[RATIONALE]
• Good explanation and structure
• Clear solutions linked to causes
• A bit repetitive in places
