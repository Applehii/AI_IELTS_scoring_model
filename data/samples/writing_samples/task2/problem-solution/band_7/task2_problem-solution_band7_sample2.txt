[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Poor air quality poses significant risks to both individuals and society. Firstly, long-term exposure to polluted air increases the likelihood of respiratory illnesses, including asthma and lung cancer. Secondly, pollution reduces overall quality of life, making outdoor activities unpleasant and discouraging tourism.
A practical solution is for governments to restrict the use of high-emission vehicles and support cleaner transport options such as electric buses. Another effective measure is planting more trees in urban areas to absorb harmful substances. Together, these strategies could gradually improve urban air quality.

[OVERVIEW]
Air pollution harms health and quality of life; cleaner transport and green spaces help.

[RATIONALE]
• Strong coherence and clear progression
• Solutions well matched to problems
• Could benefit from more sophisticated linking
