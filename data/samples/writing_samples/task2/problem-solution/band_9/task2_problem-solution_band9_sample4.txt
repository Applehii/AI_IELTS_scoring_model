[QUESTION]
The rise of online misinformation has become a serious issue. What problems does it create and how can they be solved?

[SUMMARY]
Online misinformation contributes to political polarisation and undermines trust in public institutions. False information spreads faster than fact-checked content, leading people to make harmful decisions about health, elections, or public safety.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Online misinformation contributes to political polarisation and undermines trust in public institutions. False information spreads faster than fact-checked content, leading people to make harmful decisions about health, elections, or public safety. This erosion of trust weakens social cohesion and destabilises democratic processes.
A comprehensive response requires robust regulation. Governments should work with technology companies to detect and remove false content more rapidly. In parallel, digital literacy programmes must be introduced in schools so individuals can critically evaluate online information. When technological and educational measures operate together, societies become far more resilient against misinformation.

[OVERVIEW]
Misinformation harms democracy and public trust; technological control and digital literacy are essential.

[RATIONALE]
• Highly coherent argument with clear logic
• Excellent register and precise vocabulary
• Strong and relevant solutions
