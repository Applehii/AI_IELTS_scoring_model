[QUESTION]
The rapid rise of automation is replacing many jobs. What problems does this create, and what solutions can be implemented?

[SUMMARY]
Automation threatens employment stability and widens social inequality. Low-skilled workers are particularly vulnerable, as machines can perform routine tasks more efficiently and at lower cost.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Automation threatens employment stability and widens social inequality. Low-skilled workers are particularly vulnerable, as machines can perform routine tasks more efficiently and at lower cost. This displacement increases unemployment rates and fuels resentment among affected communities.
To address this challenge, governments should subsidise retraining programmes that prepare workers for roles requiring human skills—such as creativity, communication, and problem-solving. Companies that adopt automation should also contribute to transition funds supporting displaced workers. Such proactive strategies ensure that technological progress benefits society as a whole.

[OVERVIEW]
Automation displaces workers and increases inequality; retraining and transition funding are essential.
