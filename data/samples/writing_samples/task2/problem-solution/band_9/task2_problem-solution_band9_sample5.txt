[QUESTION]
The decline of traditional cultures is becoming more common. What problems does this cause and what can be done?

[SUMMARY]
The erosion of traditional cultures poses risks not only to national identity but also to social stability. When cultural practices disappear, younger generations lose a sense of belonging, which may lead to alienation and weakened community bonds.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The erosion of traditional cultures poses risks not only to national identity but also to social stability. When cultural practices disappear, younger generations lose a sense of belonging, which may lead to alienation and weakened community bonds. Economically, cultural loss also reduces tourism revenues in countries that rely on heritage sites and festivals.
To mitigate these effects, governments should prioritise cultural education in schools and promote local crafts and traditions through funding and media campaigns. Digital archiving can also preserve endangered cultural elements for future generations. By combining preservation with modern promotion, traditions can remain relevant in contemporary society.

[OVERVIEW]
Cultural decline weakens identity and tourism; education, funding, and digitisation protect traditions.
