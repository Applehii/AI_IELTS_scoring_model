[QUESTION]
Many cities face a shortage of affordable housing. What problems does this cause, and what solutions are possible?

[SUMMARY]
A lack of affordable housing leads to financial strain and social inequality. Low-income families are often forced to live in overcrowded or unsafe areas, which affects their physical and mental well-being.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
A lack of affordable housing leads to financial strain and social inequality. Low-income families are often forced to live in overcrowded or unsafe areas, which affects their physical and mental well-being. Additionally, housing shortages push essential workers—such as teachers and nurses—far away from urban centres, making service delivery less efficient.
Governments should invest in large-scale social housing projects and offer tax incentives to developers who build affordable units. Implementing rent-control policies can also help stabilise market prices. These measures together ensure that cities remain accessible to all social groups.

[OVERVIEW]
Housing shortages increase inequality; social housing and rent control are effective solutions.

[RATIONALE]
• Highly relevant ideas with depth
• Excellent structure and coherence
• Solutions fully aligned with causes
