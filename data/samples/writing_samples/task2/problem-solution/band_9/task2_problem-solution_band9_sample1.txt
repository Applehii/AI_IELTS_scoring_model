[QUESTION]
Many countries are facing a rise in obesity. What problems does this lead to, and what solutions can be implemented?

[SUMMARY]
The global increase in obesity has triggered both serious health concerns and substantial economic costs. Medically, overweight individuals are far more vulnerable to chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease, placing significant pressure on already overstretched healthcare systems.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
The global increase in obesity has triggered both serious health concerns and substantial economic costs. Medically, overweight individuals are far more vulnerable to chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease, placing significant pressure on already overstretched healthcare systems. From a societal perspective, obesity reduces workforce productivity because employees with poor health take more sick leave and perform less efficiently.
To tackle this issue, governments must implement comprehensive public-health campaigns that promote balanced diets and regular exercise. Additionally, introducing taxes on sugary and highly processed foods would discourage overconsumption. Schools can also play a pivotal role by integrating mandatory physical education and ensuring that students have access to nutritious meals. Together, these coordinated actions can effectively curb rising obesity rates.

[OVERVIEW]
Obesity harms both health and economies; education, taxation, and school programmes provide effective long-term solutions.
