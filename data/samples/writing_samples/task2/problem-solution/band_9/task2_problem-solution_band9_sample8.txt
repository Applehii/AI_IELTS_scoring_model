[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Long working hours have serious consequences on both personal well-being and organisational efficiency. Employees who consistently work overtime face burnout, which reduces creativity and increases the likelihood of mistakes. On a social level, long hours deprive individuals of family time, contributing to deteriorating relationships and declining birth rates.
To address this, governments should introduce legislation limiting overtime and requiring companies to track working hours transparently. Employers can also encourage remote work and flexible scheduling. Such reforms help people maintain a healthy work–life balance.

[OVERVIEW]
Overwork leads to burnout and social decline; legislation and flexible work improve balance.
