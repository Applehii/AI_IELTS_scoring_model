[QUESTION]
Many cities are suffering from worsening air pollution. What problems arise from this, and what measures can be taken?

[SUMMARY]
Air pollution in metropolitan areas has become a critical threat to public health and urban sustainability. Prolonged exposure to toxic air particles significantly increases the risk of respiratory illnesses and shortens life expectancy.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Air pollution in metropolitan areas has become a critical threat to public health and urban sustainability. Prolonged exposure to toxic air particles significantly increases the risk of respiratory illnesses and shortens life expectancy. Moreover, polluted air reduces the liveability of cities, discouraging tourism and foreign investment.
Effective solutions must be multifaceted. Governments should impose strict emissions limits on industries and expand investment in renewable energy. Enhancing public transport to make it faster and more reliable would also reduce the dependence on private vehicles. Finally, real-time air-quality monitoring can increase transparency and motivate citizens to adopt environmentally friendly habits. Such interventions collectively address the root causes of pollution.

[OVERVIEW]
Pollution harms health and economic attractiveness; strong regulations, green energy, and public transit are essential.
