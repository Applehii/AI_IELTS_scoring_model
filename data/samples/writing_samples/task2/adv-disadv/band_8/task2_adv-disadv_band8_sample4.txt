[QUESTION]
Public transport is becoming increasingly popular. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.

[SUMMARY]
Public transport reduces traffic congestion and carbon emissions, making cities more sustainable. It is also cost-effective, providing mobility for low-income groups.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
Public transport reduces traffic congestion and carbon emissions, making cities more sustainable. It is also cost-effective, providing mobility for low-income groups. However, the system often suffers from overcrowding and inconsistent service quality. Delays or poor maintenance may discourage regular use. In summary, public transport is essential for urban development, yet it requires continuous investment to remain reliable.

[OVERVIEW]
Eco-friendly and affordable but hindered by delays and overcrowding.

[RATIONALE]
• Strong analytical depth
• Advanced lexis (sustainable, maintenance)
• Clear structure
