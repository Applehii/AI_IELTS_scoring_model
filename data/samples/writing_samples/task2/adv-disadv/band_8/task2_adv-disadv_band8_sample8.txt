[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
The countryside offers cleaner air, lower living costs, and a calmer lifestyle. It enables stronger community relationships and reduces daily stress. However, rural areas often lack professional opportunities and advanced healthcare. Young people may find it difficult to build a career or access specialised services. Thus, the countryside provides a peaceful environment but limits long-term development.

[OVERVIEW]
Relaxed living vs. lack of opportunities.
