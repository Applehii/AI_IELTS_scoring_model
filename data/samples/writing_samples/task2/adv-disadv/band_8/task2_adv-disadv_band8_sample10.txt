[QUESTION]
Many tourists choose package holidays. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.

[SUMMARY]
Package holidays provide convenience because travel arrangements, accommodation, and activities are organised in advance. They often offer competitive prices and ensure safety through professional guidance.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 8
Package holidays provide convenience because travel arrangements, accommodation, and activities are organised in advance. They often offer competitive prices and ensure safety through professional guidance. Nevertheless, they limit personal freedom and may force travellers into crowded tourist destinations. Some packages prioritise profit over authenticity. Hence, package holidays are efficient but may not deliver meaningful travel experiences.

[OVERVIEW]
Convenient and safe but less authentic.

[RATIONALE]
• Deep insight (authenticity, profit-driven)
• Effective cohesion
• Rich academic-style vocabulary
