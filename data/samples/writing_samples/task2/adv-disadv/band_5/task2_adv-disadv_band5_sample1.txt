[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 5
Studying abroad has some clear benefits. Students can learn a new language easier and experience a different lifestyle. This helps them become more confident. However, it is also very expensive, so not all families can support it. Some students feel homesick and find it hard to adapt to the new environment. Therefore, studying abroad has both good and bad sides.

[OVERVIEW]
New experiences and skills, but high cost and stress.

[RATIONALE]
• Ideas exist but are not extended
• Vocabulary basic (“good and bad sides”)
• Grammar errors (“learn… easier”)
• Limited development
