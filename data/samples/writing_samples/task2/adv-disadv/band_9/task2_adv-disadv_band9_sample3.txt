[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Domestic robots streamline household tasks, giving people more time for work, leisure, or family life. They can also improve safety by handling dangerous chores. Nevertheless, excessive reliance on robots may reduce essential life skills and weaken family cooperation. Their high cost raises concerns about widening inequality, as only wealthy households can afford advanced devices. Ultimately, home robotics enhances convenience but risks social and economic imbalance.

[OVERVIEW]
Highly convenient but may widen inequality and reduce life skills.

[RATIONALE]
