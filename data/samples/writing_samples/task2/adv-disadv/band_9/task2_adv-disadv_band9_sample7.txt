[QUESTION]
Many companies are replacing human workers with automation. What are the advantages and disadvantages?

[SUMMARY]
Automation enhances efficiency by eliminating human error and enabling continuous production. It allows firms to allocate labour to more creative or strategic tasks.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Automation enhances efficiency by eliminating human error and enabling continuous production. It allows firms to allocate labour to more creative or strategic tasks. However, rapid automation risks large-scale job displacement, particularly among low-skilled workers, potentially exacerbating economic inequality. Societies must also confront ethical concerns regarding AI autonomy and accountability. Thus, automation is economically beneficial but socially disruptive if not managed responsibly.

[OVERVIEW]
Boosts efficiency but threatens employment and deepens inequality.

[RATIONALE]
• Insightful economic & ethical evaluation
• Rich vocabulary (displacement, autonomy, accountability)
• High-level structure
