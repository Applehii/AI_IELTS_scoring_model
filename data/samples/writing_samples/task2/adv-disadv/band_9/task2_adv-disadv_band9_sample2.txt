[QUESTION]
Some companies allow employees to take unlimited vacation leave. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.

[SUMMARY]
Unlimited leave policies empower employees to manage their well-being autonomously, often resulting in higher productivity and stronger loyalty toward their employer.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Unlimited leave policies empower employees to manage their well-being autonomously, often resulting in higher productivity and stronger loyalty toward their employer. They also signal organisational trust, which improves workplace culture. Nonetheless, such policies can generate inequality, as high-pressure roles may prevent employees from taking sufficient time off. Additionally, without clear guidelines, some individuals may overuse or underuse the benefit, creating tension within teams. Thus, unlimited leave is transformative but requires robust management frameworks to function effectively.

[OVERVIEW]
Promotes autonomy and trust but risks inequality and misuse.

[RATIONALE]
• Highly nuanced arguments
• Sophisticated vocabulary (autonomously, transformative, frameworks)
• Balanced, multi-layered reasoning
