[QUESTION]
Electric cars are becoming increasingly popular. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.

[SUMMARY]
Electric vehicles significantly reduce urban air pollution and reliance on fossil fuels, making them essential in combating climate change. Lower maintenance costs also make them financially attractive in the long term.

[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Electric vehicles significantly reduce urban air pollution and reliance on fossil fuels, making them essential in combating climate change. Lower maintenance costs also make them financially attractive in the long term. Nevertheless, the environmental benefits depend heavily on the energy source used for charging; in regions powered by coal, emissions remain substantial. Moreover, battery disposal poses ecological risks, and limited charging infrastructure restricts widespread adoption. Thus, electric cars are a crucial but incomplete solution to sustainable transport.

[OVERVIEW]
Eco-friendly but constrained by energy sources and infrastructure.

[RATIONALE]
• Deep, critical evaluation
• High-level environmental vocabulary
• Demonstrates nuanced understanding of dependencies
