[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 9
Digital books revolutionise access to information by allowing readers to carry thousands of titles on a single device. They are usually cheaper, instantly downloadable, and environmentally friendly due to reduced paper consumption. However, extended screen exposure can cause eye strain, and digital reading lacks the tactile engagement many people find essential to deep comprehension. Furthermore, dependence on electronic devices raises concerns over data privacy and long-term accessibility of digital archives. Overall, while e-books offer unparalleled convenience, they cannot fully replace the sensory and archival reliability of printed texts.

[OVERVIEW]
Highly accessible and eco-friendly, yet less immersive and potentially risky for long-term preservation.

[RATIONALE]
• Very academic tone
• Deep insight about comprehension & data permanence
• Complex, natural sentence structures
