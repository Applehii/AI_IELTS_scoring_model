Apartments are usually cheaper than houses, especially in big cities. They also require less maintenance, which is convenient for busy people. However, apartments often have limited space, making them uncomfortable for large families. Noise from neighbours can also be a problem. Therefore, apartments are suitable for small families but not for everyone.

[OVERVIEW]
Affordable but small and noisy.
