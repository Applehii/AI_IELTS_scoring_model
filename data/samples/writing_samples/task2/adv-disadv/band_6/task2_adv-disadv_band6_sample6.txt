[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 6
Eating out saves time for people who are busy, and restaurants offer a wide variety of food that may not be easy to cook at home. However, restaurant meals often contain high levels of salt and oil, which can affect health. Eating out frequently is also more expensive than cooking at home. So while restaurants are convenient, they are not always healthy or affordable.

[OVERVIEW]
Variety and convenience but unhealthy and costly.

[RATIONALE]
• Adequate development
• Some repetitive phrasing
• No strong concluding insight
