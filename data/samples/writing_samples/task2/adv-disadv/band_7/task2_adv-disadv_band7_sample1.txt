[SAMPLE_ANSWER]
Band 7
Online shopping offers great convenience because people can buy items at any time without travelling to stores. It also allows easy price comparison, helping consumers make better decisions. However, shoppers cannot check product quality directly, which sometimes leads to disappointment. In addition, delivery delays and extra shipping fees can be frustrating. Despite these drawbacks, online shopping remains a popular and efficient option for many people.

[OVERVIEW]
Convenient and cost-saving, but issues with product reliability and delivery.

[RATIONALE]
• Clearly developed arguments
• Good range of vocabulary (compare, delays, disappointing)
• Well-structured, but still lacks highly sophisticated ideas
