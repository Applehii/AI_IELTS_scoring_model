Process Diagram Guide:
- Identify the first and last stages clearly.
- Describe each stage in logical order.
- Use passive voice (is produced, is heated, is transported).
- Use sequencing connectors (first, next, following this, finally).
- Group stages if they share a similar function.
- No comparisons — describe steps only.
